</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> Paul Bunyan legend had its origin in the Papineau
Rebellion of 1837. This was a revolt of the
French-Canadians against their young English queen.
In the Two Mountains country, at St. Eustache, many
loggers armed with mattocks, axes, and wooden forks
which had been steamed and warped into hooks,
stormed into battle. Among them was a mighty-muscled,
bellicose, bearded giant named Paul Bunyon.
This forest warrior, with a mattock in one hand, and
a great fork in the other, powerful as Hercules, indomitable
as Spartacus, bellowing like a furious
Titan, raged among the Queen’s troops like Samson
among the Philistines. He came out of the rebellion
with great fame among his own kind. His slaughters
got the grandeur of legend.</p>

<p>Later this Paul Bunyon operated a logging camp.
In that day logging was heroic labor. In the autumn
the loggers went to the woods, forcing their way in
batteaux up swift rivers. On every trip there were
many wearisome portages around rapids. Snow and
ice then locked them in their camps for five or six
months. The workday was from dawn to dusk.
The loggers lived on beans, salt pork and sourdough
bread. At night there were songs and tales around
the shanty stove. Of course these were mainly about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
their own life, their own heroes. The camp boss was
like the chief of a tribe; his will had to be the law, and
he had to have exceptional physical power and courage
to enforce it. After his part in the rebellion there was
no more famous camp chief in Canada than Paul
Bunyon.</p>

<p>Sure that the Paul Bunyan stories which have been
told for generations in the American timberlands were
of Canadian origin, I questioned many old time
French-Canadian loggers before I found genuine
proofs. At last I met Louis Letourneau in the
Big Berry country, Puyallup, Washington. And
Louis’ father-in-law, Z. Berneche, a snowy-maned,
shining-eyed, keen-minded veteran logger of ninety
years, told me about the original hero. His uncle,
Collet Bellaine, fought by the side of Paul Bunyon,
and later worked two seasons for him. Now, the
French-Canadians have no genius for the humor
of purposeful exaggeration such as the Americans
have; the <em>habitans</em> exaggerate honestly and enthusiastically
and with an illusion of truth, like Tartarin
of Tarascon.</p>

<p>“My uncle, Collet Bellaine,” said Mr. Berneche
earnestly, “know that Paul Bunyon carry five hundred
pounds on portage. That is truth. He was
very big, strong man, you understand; he fight like
hell, he work like hell, and he pack like hell. Never
was another man like Paul Bunyon. That’s right.”</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine the <em>habitans</em> honestly
exaggerating the logging feats of the war hero as they
talked about him in the New Brunswick camps, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Maine, and in the Great Lakes pineries. And it is
simple for one who has seen the two races together to
imagine the Americans “improving” on the first stories
about Paul Bunyon, only to ridicule his extravagant
admirers; and then developing their own Paul Bunyan
legend to ease their weariness when their twelve-hour
day was done.</p>

<p>Other evidence supports this view of the origin of
the stories. There are stories told about an Irish-French-Canadian
logger, Joe Mufraw (Murphy was
his ancestral name); and the name of Joe Mufraw
is famous in the woods, sometimes being linked
with Paul Bunyan’s. He appears in the Red River
Lumber Company’s collection of Paul Bunyan stories.
Now, Joe Mufraw logged in the Misstassinny
River country in Quebec less than fifty years ago.
I have seen pictures of this huge frowning man
and his oxen. Many old French-Canadians have
sworn to me that he put the calks in his boots in the
shape of his initials, and that after the thirteenth drink
he would kick his initials in a ceiling eight feet high.
His feats in camp and on the log drives were as
magnificent.</p>

<p>It was the American loggers below the Border who
made of Paul Bunyon a true hero of camp nights’
entertainment. They gave him Babe, the blue ox,
who measured forty-two ax handles and a plug of
chewing tobacco between the horns. They created
the marvelous mythical logging camp, with its cookhouse
of mountainous size and history of Olympian
feats; and they peopled this camp with astounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
minor heroes. They made their Paul Bunyan
an inventor and orator, and an industrialist whose
labors surpassed those of Hercules. They devised
a chronology for him; he ruled American life in
the period between the Winter of the Blue Snow
and the Spring That the Rain Came Up From China.
By 1860 Paul Bunyan had become a genuine American
legendary hero.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Paul Bunyan narrator who won most
lasting fame was Len Day, whose firm of Len Day &amp;
Son was one of the largest lumber concerns of Minneapolis
in the sixties. I had often heard of him;
and lately Mr. Michael Christopher Quinn, yard
superintendent for the Northwestern Lumber Company,
of Hoquiam, Washington, for twenty-two years,
gave me a first-hand account of him. In 1873
Quinn was working in a great log drive down the
Mississippi; his camp was at Haney Landing, Minnesota.
Len Day was then eighty-five, a prosperous
and influential lumberman. But the lure of the drive
and of camp life still stirred the true logger’s soul of
him, and he came to the camp each spring. Every
night the gang gathered in the cookhouse to hear the
old camp bard declaim a canto of the Paul Bunyan
epic.</p>

<p>“Len Day told the stories in sections,” said Mr.
Quinn.</p>

<p>A section, or a canto, or a chapter, or whatever one
may call it, was delivered each night by the old
lumberman, who could see toiling demi-gods and
sweating heroes in his dark woods, and imagined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
narratives about them, to which he gave the substance
and characters of the traditional Paul Bunyan stories.
Len Day had lived in New Brunswick in the forties
and had thus heard the stories in their beginnings.
The Paul Bunyan stories which form the body of
the legend have not had many changes or surviving
additions in fifty years. They themselves are not a
narrative; they exist, rather, as a group of anecdotes
which are told among a group of camp men until the
story-teller of the gang is started on a narrative which
he makes up as he yarns along, and which may take
him an hour, or three evenings, to relate. A Paul
Bunyan bunkhouse service is a glory to hear, when it
is spontaneous and in a proper setting; preferably
around a big heater in the winter, when the wind is
howling through crackling boughs outside, and the
pungent smell of steaming wool drifts down from the
drying lines above the stove. When the vasty spirit
of the woods really moves the meeting a noble and
expansive ecstasy of the soul is exhibited. Remarks
are passed about a similar night in Paul Bunyan’s
camp, when the wind blew so hard that Big Ole, the
blacksmith, had to bolt iron straps over the logs to
keep them from being sucked up the chimneys. The
theme grows and bears strange fruits; and finally the
camp bard harvests them all in a story based on such
a venerable anecdote as that one about Big Ole toting
one of Babe’s ox shoes for half a mile and sinking knee-deep
into the solid rock at every step.</p>

<p>This anecdote is what might be called a “key story,”
for it is one of the very old ones. There are at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
a hundred of these, all familiar to every man who has
worked long in the woods. They all deal with some
of the characters whom tradition has placed about
Paul Bunyan, with the mighty logger himself as the
main hero; their settings are in such regions as the
Onion River country, the Bullfrog Lake country, or
the Leaning Pine country; and each one is a theme
for gorgeous yarns, when a knowing and gifted camp
bard is inspired to use it.</p>

<p>Nowadays, with a shed garage in every logging
camp, a radio in the camp office, graphophones in the
bunkhouses, and a jazz shack in the village just “over
the hump,” the camp bard has a scant audience. But
in happier times each camp enjoyed its chief story-teller;
and such a bard could take one of the key
stories and elaborate on it for hours, building a
complete narrative, picturing awe-inspiring characters,
inventing dialogue of astonishing eloquence. (And
what stupendous curses, terrifying threats and verbose
orations such bards as Happy Olsen and Old Time
Sandy could invent!) It is the method of the old
bards that I have attempted to follow in writing this
book.</p>

<p>The art of the plain American, which in the last
century brought forth tales and songs as native to the
soil as the grass of the prairies, is at last perishing
under the feet of the herd arts of a perfected
democratic culture. The legends about Buffalo Bill
and Brigham Young have passed; these heroes are now
plain figures in book history. Jim Bridger, the
heroic “old man of the mountains,” is obscenely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
and falsely portrayed in a movie to draw snickers
from the chiropractors, pants salesmen and tin-roofers
who are the passionate devotees of this carnal herd
art. Kentucky and Tennessee mountain folk still
tell their tales about “ol’ Dan’l,” tales in which
the listener will discover a Boone a thousand times
more picturesque and grand than the hero of written
history. Crockett, Carson, old Andy Jackson, Sam
Houston—but I could name a score whom the plain
man’s untutored art ennobled and glorified in a manner
that put the erudite narrators to shame. This
art is perishing simply because Universal Education,
and other blights, curses and evil inventions of democracy
are destroying all the old simplicity, imaginativeness
and self-amusement of plain American life.</p>

<p>Only in a few regions, and among the elders, do the
creations of this art, this folk lore, or whatever one
wills to call it, survive as shining memorials to sturdier
and nobler days. And the legend of Paul Bunyan is
certainly the greatest of these creations; for it embodies
the souls of the millions of American camp men who
have always done the hard and perilous pioneer labor
of this country. It is true American legend now, for
Paul Bunyan, as he stands to-day, is absolutely
American from head to foot. He visualizes perfectly
the American love of tall talk and tall doings, the true
American exuberance and extravagance. Beginning
in Paul Bunyon, soldier with Papineau, he has become
the creation of whole generations of men. Thousands
of narrators by far-flung campfires have contributed
their mites to the classical picture of him. And he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
at least, will live as long as there is a forest for his
refuge, as long as there are shadows and whispers of
trees.</p>

<p>I want to thank the old camp comrades who have
sent me so many versions of all the known key stories,
and who have given me accounts of new ideas. They,
and several lumbermen also, have been very kind to me.
And I owe gratitude particularly to Mr. H.&#160;L.
Mencken, of the <i>American Mercury</i>. Without his
help and encouragement the stories would not have
been written.</p>

BLUE SNOW</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Paul Bunyan</span> was the one historian of the useful and
the beautiful; other writers of history tell only of
terrible and dramatic events. Therefore the chronicles
of Paul Bunyan, the mighty logger, the inventor
of the lumber industry, the leader-hero of the best
band of bullies, the finest bunch of savages, that ever
tramped the continent, the master orator of a land that
has since grown forests of orators—his chronicles alone
tell of the Winter of the Blue Snow.</p>

<p>The blue snow fell first in the North. It fell
scantily in its earlier hours, its sapphire flakes floating
down on the waves of a mild winter wind, and
glittering in an ashen gold light, a sober pale
radiance which shimmered through silver mists.
There was poetry in the spectacle of these hours. And
then the hard gray ground of a peopleless land was
hidden under a blanket of dark blue. And the nameless
frozen lakes and rivers, the silent valleys and the
windy hills of the country were all spread over with
a sky-dyed snow. When the last light of this day
went out, the boughs of the great pines were creaking
under heavy wet masses of snow like torn bales of blue
cotton. There was a rush in the snowfall now,
as a fiercer wind whipped it on; its heavy flakes
were driven down in thick, whirling clusters, in streaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
veils, leaping lines and dashing columns; and there
were cloudlike swarms of the blue flakes, which
settled slowly, floating easily in the hard wind. This
wind got so strong that it shivered the timber, and the
piles of blue snow which had gathered on the pine
boughs were shaken down. Most of this snow fell
into blue mounds around the trees, but some of it fell
on the fauna of the forest, adding to their troublement.</p>

<p>At the time of the Winter of the Blue Snow, the
forest creatures of this land lived a free and easy life.
Man was not there to embarrass them with accusations
of trespass and to slay them for their ignorance of
the crime. Their main problem was the overcrowding
of the forests. The vast moose herds, who populated
the woods so densely that traffic through their favorite
timber was dangerous, made the matter of getting food
a simple one for the carnivorous animals. There were
many moose to spare, and the elders of the herds, like
most prolific parents, never became frantically resentful
over the loss of an offspring. The moose themselves,
of course, lived easily on the crisp, juicy moose
grass which grew so plenteously in these regions before
the blue snow. So the carnivorous creatures of the
forests lived a fast and furious life; and it is certain
that if they were capable of praise, they had good
praises for the moose meat which they got with such
little difficulty. The coal-black bruins of the North
were an especially happy crowd. Theirs was a gay,
frolicsome life in the summer time, when the big
bruins danced and galloped through sunny valleys
and the small ones had rolling races on shady hillsides.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
In the fall, all fat and drowsy from moose
meat, the bruins would go to sleep in their warm caves
and dream pleasantly all winter.</p>

<p>They were all dreaming now; and the blue snow
would no doubt have fallen and melted away without
their knowledge had it not been for the moose herds
which crowded the forest aisles. Moose at that time
did not have it in them to enjoy wonder, and they had
not learned to combat fear, for they were never afraid.
Still, they had some imagination, and the moose
trembled when the first blue snowflakes fell among
them. They kept up an appearance of unconcern at
first, eating moose moss as usual; but they sniffed
gingerly at the blue streaks in it, and they stole furtive
glances at each other as they bravely ate. This
strange snowfall was certainly breeding fear of it in
the hearts of all the moose, but each one seemed determined
to be the last one to show it. However, as
the day-end got near, and the wind grew more boisterous,
shaking snow masses from the trees, some of
the moose had fits of trembling and eye-rolling which
they could not conceal. When a heap of snow
dropped on the back of some timid moose, he would
twist his head sharply and stare with bulging eyes at
the mysteriously fearsome color, then he would prance
wildly until the unwelcome snow was bucked from his
shivering back. When the early shadows of evening
came among the trees, the moose all had a heavy darkness
of fear in their hearts. Little was needed to put
them in a panic.</p>

<p>It was a great bull moose, a herd king, who forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
the example he owed to his weaker kindred and unloosed
a thunderous bellow of terror which started the
moose flight, the first memorable incident of the Winter
of the Blue Snow. An overladen bough cracked
above him; it fell and straddled him from quivering
tail to flailing horns, burying him under its wet blue
load. He reared out roaring, and his own herd echoed
the cry; then a storm of moose bellows crashed through
the forest. This tumult died, but there followed the
earth-shaking thunder of a stampede.</p>

<p>The bruins, awakened from their pleasant dreams,
came out from their caves and blinked at the hosts of
terrified moose which were galloping past. The earth-shaking
uproar of the flight at last thoroughly aroused
the bruins, and they began to sniff the air uneasily.
Then they noticed the blue snow; and now in front
of every cave crowds of bruins were staring down at
the snow; and each bruin was swaying heavily, lifting
his left front foot as he swayed to the right, and lifting
his right front foot as he swayed to the left. The
bruins had no courage either, and, once they had got
sleep out of their heads, nearly all of them took out
after the moose herds. The wind roared louder with
every passing minute this night. And the flakes of the
blue snow were as dense as the particles of a fog. At
dawn a blue blizzard was raging. But the fauna of
the forest plunged tirelessly on, seeking a refuge of
white snow.</p>

<p>And Niagara, made faithless by the Blue Terror,
galloped behind them—Niagara, the great moose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
hound, bread-winner for the student of history, Paul
Bunyon (his real name), and his companion also.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyon lived at Tonnere Bay. He dwelt in
a cave that was as large as ten Mammoth Caves and
which had a roof loftier than any tower or spire. But
this cave was none too vast for Paul Bunyon, the one
man of this region, but one man as great as a city of
ordinary men. His tarpaulins and blankets covered
one-fourth of the cave floor; his hunting clothes, traps
and seines filled another quarter; and the rest of the
space was occupied by a fireplace and his papers and
books.</p>

<p>For Paul Bunyon was a student now. There had
been a time when he had gone forth in the hunting and
fishing season to gather the huge supplies of provender
which he required, but now his days and nights were all
spent with his books. Paul Bunyon’s favorite food
was raw moose meat, and after he found Niagara in
the Tall Wolf country he no longer needed to hunt.
Each night Niagara trotted out in the darkness and
satisfied his own hunger, then he carried mouthfuls of
moose to the cave until he had a day’s supply of meat
for his master. Niagara was ever careful not to
frighten the moose herds; he hunted stealthily and
with quiet. The moose at night were only conscious
of a dark cloud looming over them, then numbers of
the herds would disappear without painful sound.
The moose, if they had thought about it, would have
been only thankful to Niagara for lessening the congestion
of the forests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>So Paul Bunyon fared well on the moose meat
which Niagara brought him, and he lived contentedly
as a student in his cave at Tonnere Bay. Each day
he studied, and far into the night he figured. Taking
a trimmed pine tree for a pencil, he would char its
end in the fire and use the cave floor for a slate. He
was not long in learning all the history worth knowing,
and he became as good a figurer as any man could be.</p>

<p>Vague ambitions began to stir in his soul after this
and he often deserted his studies to dream about them.
He knew he would not spend his days forever in the
cave at Tonnere Bay. Somewhere in the future a
great Work was waiting to be done by him. Now it
was only a dream; but he was sure that it would be a
reality; and he came to think more and more about it.
The books were opened less and less; the pine tree
pencil was seldom brought from its corner. Paul
Bunyon now used another pine tree which still had its
boughs; it was a young one, and he brushed his curly
black beard with it as he dreamed. But he was still
a contented man at the time of the Winter of the Blue
Snow, for his dreams had not yet blazed up in a desire
for any certain attainment.</p>

<p>On the first day of the blue snow, Paul Bunyon
was in a particularly contented mood. He sat all that
day before his fire; so charmed with drowsy thoughts
was he that he did not once look out. It had been
dark a long time before he rolled into his blankets.
He awoke at the dawn of a day that had scarcely more
light than the night. He was cold, and he got up to
throw an armful of trees on the fire. Then he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the blue drifts which had piled up before the cave, and
he saw the fog of the blue blizzard. He heard the
roar of a terrific wind, too, and he knew that the storm
was perilous as well as strange. But Paul Bunyon
thought gladly of the blue snow, for it was a beautiful
event, and the historians he liked most would write
wonderful books about it.</p>

<p>He kicked the drifts away from the cave entrance,
but the usual pile of slain moose was not under them.
Paul Bunyon was a little worried, as he thought that
Niagara might have lost himself in the blue blizzard.
The possibility that the unnatural color of the storm
might send the fauna of the forest, and Niagara as
well, into panicky flight did not occur to him. He
was sure that Niagara would return with a grand supply
of moose meat when the blue blizzard had passed.</p>

<p>But the moose herds were now far to the North,
fleeing blindly from the blue snow. The bruins galloped
after them. Before the day was over, Niagara
had overtaken the bruins and was gaining on the
moose. At nightfall his lunging strides had carried
him far ahead of all the fauna of the forest. He
galloped yet faster as he reached the blacker darkness
of the Arctic winter. Now the darkness was so heavy
that even his powerful eyes could not see in it....
Niagara at last ran head-on into the North Pole; the
terrific speed at which he was traveling threw his
body whirling high in the air; when Niagara fell he
crashed through ninety feet of ice, and the polar fields
cracked explosively as his struggles convulsed the
waters under them.... Then only mournful blasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
of wind sounded in the night of the Farthest North.</p>

<p>The moose were wearied out before they reached the
white Arctic, and hordes of them fell and perished in
the blizzard; many others died from fright, and only
a tiny remnant of the great herds survived. Some
of the bruins reached the polar fields, and they have
lived there since. Their hair had turned white from
fright, and their descendants still wear that mark of
fear. Others were not frightened so much, and their
hair only turned gray. They did not run out of the
timber, and their descendants, the silver-tip grizzlies,
still live in the Northern woods. The baby bruins
were only scared out of their growth, and their black
descendants now grow no larger than the cubs of
Paul Bunyon’s time.</p>

<p>Being ignorant of this disaster, Paul Bunyon was
comfortable enough while the blizzard lasted. He
had a good store of trees on hand and his cave was
warm in the storm. He got hungry in the last days;
but this emotion, or any emotion, for that matter, could
have but little power over him when he was dreaming.
And he dreamed deeply now of great enterprises; his
dreams were formless, without any substance of reality;
but they had brilliant colors, and they made him very
hopeful.</p>

<p>The sun shone at last from a whitish blue sky, and
the strange snow fell no more. A snapping cold was
in the land; and pine boughs were bangled and brocaded
with glittering blue crystals, and crusty blue
snow crackled underfoot.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyon strapped on his snow shoes and started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
out through the Border forests in search of Niagara.
His was a kingly figure as he mushed through the pine
trees, looming above all but the very tallest of them.
He wore a wine-red hunting cap, and his glossy hair
and beard shone under it with a blackness that blended
with the cap’s color perfectly. His unique eyebrows
were black also; covering a fourth of his forehead
above the eyes, they narrowed where they arched down
under his temples, and they ended in thin curls just in
front of his ears. His mustache had natural twirls and
he never disturbed it. He wore a yellow muffler this
morning under his virile curly beard. His mackinaw
coat was of huge orange and purple checks. His
mackinaw pants were sober-seeming, having tan and
light gray checks, but some small crimson dots and
crosses brightened them. Green wool socks showed
above his black boots, which had buckskin laces and
big brass eyelets and hooks. And he wore striped mittens
of white and plum color. Paul Bunyon was a
gorgeous picture this morning in the frozen fields and
forests, all covered with blue snow which sparkled in
a pale gold light.</p>

<p>That day and the next, and for five more days, he
searched in vain for Niagara; and neither did he see
any moose herds in the woods. Only the frost crackles
broke the silences of the deserted blue forests.
And at last Paul Bunyon returned to his cave, feeling
depressed and lonely. He had not thought that the
companionship of Niagara could mean so much to
him. In his mood of depression he forgot his hunger
and made no further effort to find food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>Lonely Paul Bunyon lay sleepless in his blankets
this night, his eyes gleaming through hedgelike eyelashes
as their gaze restlessly followed the red flares
that shot from the fire and streaked the walls and roof
of the cave. He did not realize that his first creative
idea was now struggling for birth. He could yet feel
no shape of it. He was only conscious of an unaccustomed
turmoil of mind. Wearied with fruitless
thought, he at last fell into a doze. But Paul Bunyon
was not fated to sleep this night. A sustained
crashing roar, as of the splintering of millions of
timbers, brought him up suddenly; it was hushed for a
short second; then a thudding boom sounded from
Tonnere Bay. Paul Bunyon leaped to the cave door,
and in the moonlight he saw a white wave of water
rolling over the blue beach. It came near to the cave
before it stopped and receded. He pulled on his boots,
and two strides brought him down to the bay. It had
been covered with ice seven feet thick, and the cakes of
this broken ice were now tossing on heaving waters.
Now Paul Bunyon saw two ears show sometimes above
the billows; they were of the shape of moose ears, but
enormous as his two forefingers. Paul Bunyon waded
out into the waters, and he reached these ears a mile
from shore. He seized them without fear and he
lifted ... now a head with closed eyes appeared
... shoulders and forelegs ... body and hips ...
rear legs and curled tail. It was a calf, newborn apparently,
though it was of such a size that Paul Bunyon
had to use both arms to carry it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Nom d’un nom!</i>” exclaimed Paul Bunyon.
“<i lang="fr">Pauvre petite bleue bête!</i>”</p>

<p>For this great baby calf was of a bright blue hue
which was neither darker nor lighter than the color
of the beautiful strange snow. A blue baby ox calf.
For such was its sex. Its ears drooped pitifully, and
its scrawny, big-jointed legs hung limply below Paul
Bunyon’s arms. A spasmodic shiver ran from its head
to its tail, and its savior was glad to feel this shiver,
for it showed that life remained. Paul Bunyon was
touched with a tenderness that drove out his loneliness.
“<i lang="fr">Ma bête</i>,” he said. “<i lang="fr">Mon cher bleu bébé ausha.</i>”</p>

<p>He turned back through the waters, and the ice
cakes pounded each other into bits as they rolled together
in his wake. In thirty seconds Paul Bunyon
was back in his cave. He spread out his blankets in
front of the fire, and he laid Bébé upon them.</p>

<p>Through the night Paul Bunyon worked over the
blue ox calf, nursing him back to warm life; and in the
morning Bébé was breathing regularly and seemed to
rest. Paul Bunyon leaned over to hear his exhalations,
and the blue ox calf suddenly opened his mouth
and caressed Paul Bunyon’s neck with his tongue.
Paul Bunyon then discovered that he was ticklish in
this region, for the caress impelled him to roll and
laugh. The serious student Paul Bunyon had never
laughed before; and he now enjoyed the new pleasure
to the utmost.</p>

<p>“<em>Eh, Bébé!</em>” he chuckled. “<i lang="fr">Eh, Bébé! Sacre
bleu! Bon bleu, mon cher!</i>” Bébé raised his eyelids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
with astonishment upon hearing this cave-shaking
chuckle, revealing large, bulging orbs which were of
even a heavenlier blue than his silken hair. Such affection
and intelligence shone in his eyes that Paul
Bunyon wished he would keep his eyes opened. But
Bébé was weary and weak, and he closed them again.</p>

<p>He is hungry, thought Paul Bunyon; and he went
out to find him food. None of the animals he knew
about could supply milk for such a calf as this blue
Bébé. But he was newborn and his parents should
be somewhere in the neighborhood. Paul Bunyon
stepped up on the cliff over which Bébé had bounced
when he fell into Tonnere Bay. From here a wide
swath of smashed timber ran straight up the side of
the tallest Northern mountain. It was here that Bébé
had made his thunderous roll of the night before.</p>

<p>Six strides brought Paul Bunyon to the mountain-top.
One of its jagged peaks was broken off, showing
where Bébé had stumbled over it and fallen.
Then Paul Bunyon followed the calf tracks down the
land side of the mountain. For two hours he trailed
them, but they grew fainter as he went on, and in the
Big Bay country the last fall of the blue snow had
covered them. Paul Bunyon now had no doubt that
Bébé’s mother had been frightened by the strange color
of the snow and that his blueness was a birthmark.
Like Niagara and the fauna of the forest, the parents
had stampeded, forgetting the little one. It was
no use to search for them.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyon circled back through the forest and
gathered a great load of moose moss before he returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
to the cave. This rich food would meet the
lack of milk. Bébé was asleep before the fireplace
when Paul Bunyon returned, and he still slumbered
while his friend prepared him some moose moss soup.
But when a kettle full of steaming odorous food was
set before him, he opened his eyes with amazing energy
and sat up. It was then that Bébé first showed
the depth and circumference of his natural appetite,
an appetite which was to have its effect on history.
He drank most of the moose moss soup at three gulps,
he seized the rim of the kettle in his teeth and tilted
it up until even the last ten gallons were drained out
of it; then, looking roguishly at Paul Bunyon the
while, he bit off a large section of the kettle rim and
chewed it down, switching his pretty tail to show his
enjoyment.</p>

<p>“<em>Eh, Bébé!</em>” roared Paul Bunyon, doubling up with
laughter for the second time in his life. And he
praised the blue snow for giving him such a creature,
and did not mourn Niagara, who had never been amusing.
But now, as Paul Bunyon doubled over for another
rare roar of laughter, he got one more surprise.
He was struck with terrifical force from the rear and
knocked flat. Paul Bunyon hit the cave floor so hard
that its walls were shaken, and a cloud of stones
dropped from the roof, covering him from his hips
to his thighs. Paul Bunyon dug himself out with no
displeasure. He was marveling too much to be wrathful.</p>

<p>There is strength in this baby animal, he thought;
surely he has the muscle and energy for great deeds;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
for that was such a tremendous butting he gave me
that I am more comfortable standing than sitting. So
he stood and admired this strong and energetic ox
calf, who was calmly seated on his haunches before
the fireplace, now throwing his head to the right as he
licked his right shoulder, now throwing his head to the
left as he licked his left shoulder. While Paul Bunyon
admired, he pondered; then, even as Bébé had
given him his first laugh, the ox calf now showed him
the outline of his first real idea. The thought struck
him that his student’s life was finally over; there was
nothing more for him to learn; there was everything
for him to do. The hour for action was at hand.</p>

<p>Indeed, if he was to keep this blue ox calf, action
was truly necessary. Bébé had shown that his super-abundance
of vitality made him dangerous as well as
delightful and amusing. This inexhaustible energy
of his must be put to work; this vast store of power
in an ox-hide should be developed and harnessed to give
reality to some one of Paul Bunyon’s vague dreams.</p>

<p>Soon the well-fed blue ox calf lay down and slept
contentedly. But Paul Bunyon did not sleep. One
after another, occupations, enterprises and industries
which would be worthy of his knowledge and his extraordinary
mental and physical powers, and which
would also offer labor great enough for Bébé when he
was grown, were considered by Paul Bunyon; but
nothing that he thought about satisfied him in the least.
Certainly he would have to invent something new; and
as he thought of invention, his imagination blazed up
like a fire in a dry forest. He was so unused to it that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
it got out of control, and its smoky flames hid his
idea rather than illuminating it.</p>

<p>Wearied at last, he lay on his side, for he remembered
his bruises, and he fell into a troubled doze.
Now he dreamed and saw great blazing letters which
formed the words REAL AMERICA. He sat up, and
his bruises gave him such sudden pain that the dream
vanished utterly. But he dreamed again before morning.
In this second dream he saw no words, but a forest.
A flame like a scythe blade sheared through the
trees and they fell. Then Paul Bunyon saw in his
dream a forest of stumps, and trees were fallen among
them.</p>

<p>For many days Paul Bunyon thought about these
dreams as he gathered moose moss for Bébé and seined
fish from the bay for himself. And for many nights
he tried to dream again, but his sleep was the untroubled
sleep of the weary.</p>

<p>Bébé grew wonderfully as the weeks went by, and
the moose moss made him saucy as well as fat. His
bulging blue eyes got a jovial look that was never to
leave them. His bellow already had bass tones in
it. He would paw and snort and lift his tail as vigorously
as any ordinary ox ten times his age. His
chest deepened, his back widened, muscle-masses began
to swell and quiver under the fat of his shoulders
and haunches. The drifts of the beautiful unnatural
snow melted away in streams of blue water, and the
marvelous color of this historical winter vanished, but
the glittering blue of Bébé’s silken hair remained.
His tail brush was of a darker blue; it looked like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
heavily foliaged cypress bough in purple twilight; and
Bébé was proud of this wonderful tail brush that belonged
to him, for he would twist it from behind him
and turn his head and stare at it by the hour.</p>

<p>Now spring came and Paul Bunyon determined to
start out with his blue ox calf and try to find the
meanings of his dreams. The bright warm hours of
these days gave him a tormenting physical restlessness;
and his imagination ranged through a thousand
lands, playing over a thousand activities. It was certainly
the time to begin a Life Work.</p>

<p>Each day Paul Bunyon pondered his two dreams
without finding substantial meaning in them. The
first one indicated that he should go to Real America;
and this Paul Bunyon finally resolved to do, hoping
that he would discover the Work that was meant for
him and the blue ox calf. He knew that he could not
fare worse in that land, for few of the fauna of his
native country had returned with the spring, and
Paul Bunyon could not live well on a fish diet.
Bébé’s growing appetite, too, made some move a
necessity, for the blue snow had killed the moose grass,
and moose moss was a dry food without nourishment
in the summer. The more Paul Bunyon thought
about Real America, the better he liked the idea of
going there. Moose and grass, at least, were to be
found across the Border. And no doubt Real America
was his Land of Opportunity.</p>

<p>So one fine day Paul Bunyon and Bébé came down
to the Border. The blue ox calf frolicked with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
master and bellowed happily when he saw the green
grass and clover on the hills of Real America. He
was for rushing over at once, but Paul Bunyon, the
student, was not unmindful of his duty to his new
country; he would not enter it without fitting ceremonies
and pledges, though Bébé butted him soundly
in resenting the delay.</p>

<p>Now Paul Bunyon lifted his hands solemnly and
spoke in the rightful language of Real America.</p>

<p>“In becoming a Real American, I become Paul
<em>Bunyan</em>,” he declared. “I am Paul <em>Bunyon</em> no more.
Even so shall my blue ox calf be called Babe, and
Bébé no longer. We are now Real Americans both,
hearts, souls and hides.”</p>

<p>After uttering these words with feeling and solemnity,
an emotion more expansive, more uplifting and
more inspiring than any he had ever known possessed
Paul Bunyan and transfigured him. His chest
swelled, his eyes danced and glittered, and his cheeks
shone rosily through the black curls of his beard.</p>

<p>“And I’m glad of it!” he roared. “By the holy
old mackinaw, and by the hell-jumping, high-tailed,
fuzzy-eared, whistling old jeem cris and seventeen
slippery saints, I’m <em>proud</em> of it, too! Gloriously
proud!”</p>

<p>Then he felt amazed beyond words that the simple
fact of entering Real America and becoming a Real
American could make him feel so exalted, so pure,
so noble, so good. And an indomitable conquering
spirit had come to him also. He now felt that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
could whip his weight in wildcats, that he could pull
the clouds out of the sky, or chew up stones, or tell
the whole world anything.</p>

<p>“Since becoming a Real American,” roared Paul
Bunyan, “I can look any man straight in the eye and
tell him to go to hell! If I could meet a man of my
own size, I’d prove this instantly. We may find such
a man and celebrate our naturalization in a Real
American manner. We shall see. Yay, Babe!”</p>

<p>Then the two great Real Americans leaped over
the Border. Freedom and Inspiration and Uplift
were in the very air of this country, and Babe and
Paul Bunyan got more noble feelings in every breath.
They were greatly exhilarated physically at first; and
they galloped over valleys and hills without looking
about them, but only breathing this soul-flushing air
and roaring and bellowing their delight in it.</p>

<p>But before the day was over, Paul Bunyan discovered
that Real America had its sober, matter-of-fact
side also. A whisper stirred in his heart: “To
work! Take advantage of your opportunity!” The
whisper got louder and more insistent every moment;
and at last the idea it spoke possessed Paul Bunyan,
and he sat down to ponder it, letting Babe graze and
roll on the clover-covered hills.</p>

<p>Now the whisper became an insistent cry: “Work!
Work! Work!” Paul Bunyan looked up, and he
seemed to see the word shining among the clouds; he
looked down then into the vast valley, and he seemed
to see—by the holy old mackinaw! he did see—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
forest of his second dream! And now he knew it:
his Life Work was to begin here.</p>

<p>For many days and nights Paul Bunyan pondered
on the hillside before the Great Idea came to him.
Like all Great Ideas, it was simple enough, once he
had thought of it. Real America was covered with
forests. A forest was composed of trees. A felled
and trimmed tree was a log. Paul Bunyan threw
aside his pine tree beard brush and jumped to his feet
with a great shout.</p>

<p>“What greater work could be done in Real America
than to make logs from trees?” he cried. “Logging!
I shall invent this industry and make it the greatest
one of all time! I shall become a figure as admired in
history as any of the great ones I have read about.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan then delivered his first oration. The
blue ox calf was his only listener; and this was a
pity, for Paul Bunyan’s first oratorical effort, inspired
as it was, surely was one of his noblest ones. But we
know the outline of this oration, if not the words.
It dealt mainly with the logging method which he had
devised in the moment, the one which he used in his
first work. So he told of his plan to uproot the trees
by hand, and to transport the logs overland, binding
a bundle of them on one side of Babe, and hanging
a sack of rocks from the other side for ballast. It
was months after this that he made his first improvement,
the using of a second bundle of logs, instead
of rocks, for ballast. And at this moment Paul Bunyan,
for all his foresight and imagination, could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
have dreamed of the superb tools and marvelous logging
methods that he was to originate, or of the countless
crews of little loggers that he was to import from
France, Ireland, Scotland and Scandinavia, or of the
tremendous river drives and the mammoth camp life
he was to create. He would have been bewildered
then by the fact that he would some day need a foreman
as grand as himself for his Life Work; and the
notion that he would some day need help in his figuring
would have seemed like a far-fetched jest.</p>

<p>No; in this first oration, imaginative and eloquent
as it must have been, Paul Bunyan only spoke of
simple work for himself and Babe. But he only tells
us that the oration was not a long one, for the call to
Work came more insistently as he ended each period.
At last he had to answer this powerful call. He commanded,
“Yay, Babe!” and the baby blue ox and Paul
Bunyan descended into the valley to begin the first
logging in the Real American woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_31">THE BULL OF THE WOODS</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">“The</span> straw boss is the backbone of industry,” was
a favorite saying of Paul Bunyan’s. This sage observation
is constantly repeated to-day by industrialists
who are so overwhelmed by salesmen, efficiency
experts, welfare workers and the like that they are
forced to leave production in the hands of the powerful
race of foremen.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan had become a true man of the woods,
and paperwork troubled him. He was fortunate in
discovering the greatest man with figures that ever
lived to do his office work for him, and this man,
Johnny Inkslinger, did all the figuring alone after he
came to camp. But before the renowned timekeeper
was found the keeping of his accounts and records was
Paul Bunyan’s largest difficulty. He figured wearily
and the smell of ink often made him sick. His logging
operations grew more extensive as time went on.
He brought crews of great little men from overseas
and organized his first logging camp. He cleared off
seven hundred townships in the Smiling River country
for a big farm, and John Shears, his earnest boss
farmer, managed it so efficiently that new companies
of loggers had to be added to the camp each season
to use up the produce; consequently, more and more
timber was being felled as each season ran its course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>At last it got so that figuring occupied all of Paul
Bunyan’s time between supper and breakfast, and then
he had to take time away from work in the woods for
the keeping of his accounts. In vain he tried to increase
his speed as a figurer. He learned to write
with both hands at once; but this was no use, for the
two sets of figures would mix up in his head and result
in confusion. He invented the multiplication
table, cube root and algebra, but production increased
so fast that these short cuts gave him no more time
than before for the woods. Then he gave in to
necessity and looked about for help. No figurers
were anywhere to be discovered, so Paul Bunyan invented
bossmen to carry on the work in the woods
while he held forth in the office.</p>

<p>His first foreman was Gun Gunderson, commonly
known as “Shot” Gunderson because of his explosive
nature. He originated the “High-ball System,”
which is still used in some logging camps. Much
of the loggers’ tough vocabulary has come down from
him. His favorite words of encouragement were:
“Put a better notch in that stick or I’ll cave your
head in!” “Heave harder on that peavy handle, you
gizzardless scissor-bill, or I’ll put the calks to you!”
He began to lose power when the loggers learned his
lingo and came back at him fiercely in his own words.
His downfall happened in the second winter on Tadpole
River, in the Bullfrog Lake country. That was
the winter of the Big Wind, which blew so hard for
four months that Shot Gunderson had to yell at the
top of his voice to be heard in its howling blasts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
His voice cracked under the strain and then, of course,
his chief strength as a boss was gone. He became a
plain logger again, and Chris Crosshaulsen succeeded
him.</p>

<p>This industrious man was a worthy and well-beloved
boss, but he, too, had a fatal weakness. Such
a passion for river driving did he possess that he could
never stop the drive at its destination, but he would
run the logs on for miles and then drive them back
again. This upstream driving was terrible labor, for
each logger had to drive one log at a time; treading
it, he would roll it against the current. So much
time and energy was wasted for Chris Crosshaulsen’s
pleasure that Paul Bunyan was forced to depose him.</p>

<p>The next chief was Ole Olsen. He was so loved
that countless loggers have been named after him, but
his tender heart made him a failure as a boss. Other
bosses were Lars Larsen, Swan Swanson, Pete Peterson,
John Johnson, Jens Jensen, Anders Anderson,
Hans Hansen, and Eric Ericksen. They were all
noble men, and loggers and mill men are still named
in their honor. But not one was powerful enough to
keep his job as Paul Bunyan’s aide. Once, indeed, it
was thought that an ideal foreman had been discovered
when a burly man who called himself Murph
Murpheson was put on the job. But one night he
was heard talking Gaelic in his sleep. Cross-questioned,
he admitted that his true name was Pat
Murphy; knowing Paul Bunyan’s predilection for
Scandinavian foremen he had called himself Murph
Murpheson in order to get his high position. Deceit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
was the one human frailty that the great logger had
no tolerance for, and the Irish boss followed his predecessors.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan was now without a foreman, and he
had never had a greater need for a good one. For
his next project was to log off the Dakota country,
which was then known as the region of the Mountain
That Stood On Its Head. Difficulties loomed before
him which only he or a better foreman than he had
yet discovered could surmount. Unless he discovered
either a great figurer or a great foreman success would
be improbable.</p>

<p>Then fortune shone on him with sudden, dazzling
brightness. For word came down through the woods
that the mightiest logger of Sweden was tramping
overland for Paul Bunyan’s camp. The gossip that
ran before him called him Sweden’s greatest milker
also; and some whispered that he was the greatest
fisherman and the greatest hunter of that country of
superb giants. It was rumored that he was taller
than a tree, as tall as Paul Bunyan and as wide, and
that he feared no man. The great logger, toiling over
his vast ledgers, heard and hoped that the perfect
foreman was coming to him at last.</p>

<p>He arrived at the end of a bright June day. The
loggers were at supper, happily occupied with pea
soup and hard-tack, which were their only rations at
that time. The soup bowls before the loggers were
emptying fast, and the cookhouse resounded with a
hissing rumble, to which the clangor of the spoons
striking the bottoms of the bowls was presently added.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Then above the noise was heard a slow muffled “boom
... boom ... boom.”</p>

<p>The loggers listened and wondered. “Ol’ Paul’s
walkin’ heavy this evenin’,” said some. Said others,
“But it don’t sound like Ol’ Paul’s step anyway.”
The booming tramp sounded nearer; the cookhouse
began to shake; the loggers, curious and wondering,
gulped down the last of their soup and hurried outside.</p>

<p>Through the trees that covered the slopes above the
camp they saw a great man approaching. He was not
as tall as the tallest trees, but the shortest ones were
no higher than his waist. Yellow bristles protruded
through the crevices in the hat that was cocked on one
side of his head; he walked with a swagger that sent
the limbs crashing as he swayed against them; a good-sized
pine tree stood in his way, and he cast it aside
and marched on. When he had reached the center
of the camp he stopped and said in a commanding
voice, “Aye wan’ see Paul Bunyan.”</p>

<p>While he waited the loggers gazed in awe on his
heroic figure, and they whispered to one another that
here at last was the Swede of wonderful deeds. It
was indeed a marvelous moment for them. Every
real logger to-day would give ten years of his life to
have been among the men who first saw Hels Helsen
the mighty, the Big Swede, the incomparable Bull
of the Woods.</p>

<p>When Paul Bunyan came forth he made no attempt
to conceal his pleasure over the newcomer. For the
first time in months the darkness of worry lifted from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
his countenance and a smile shone through his beard.
He shook hands awkwardly, as this was a novel experience
for him. Here was a man whom he did not
have to look down upon to see, one man who could
reach above the great logger’s boot tops. Surely he
would make an ideal foreman; though a fierce light
glittered at moments in his blue eyes, his grin showed
that he possessed the amiability that a good foreman
must have; being a Swede, he was certainly trustworthy
and obedient.</p>

<p>In broken Real American Hels Helsen began to
tell Paul Bunyan of the purpose of his journey from
the old country. But he got no further than an account
of his hard tramp over the polar lands, where
he had lived on white bear meat and whale steak,
when Paul Bunyan stopped him.</p>

<p>“A mountain of energy, a river of power like yourself
does not need to make explanations or ask me
for anything,” said the mighty logger. “I appoint
you foreman at once, without question.”</p>

<p>“Fooreman?” asked Hels Helsen, seemingly puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Paul Bunyan heartily. “You shall be
boss over all my loggers in the timber and on the
drives. Honor and glory will be yours, for you shall
be remembered as long as men fell trees. I will give
you a fitting title. I call you ‘the Bull of the Woods,’
a name which shall be applied to only the greatest of
woods bosses hereafter because you were the first to
have it.”</p>

<p>“Har noo—” began Hels Helsen; but his words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
were drowned in the great cheer which had arisen from
the excited loggers.</p>

<p>Their enthusiasm inspired Paul Bunyan to make one
of his famous speeches. He spoke for an hour about
the historic accomplishment that was now certain in
the logging off of the Mountain That Stood On Its
Head.</p>

<p>“A cheer now, my men, for Hels Helsen, the Bull
of the Woods!” Thus Paul Bunyan ended his speech;
and the loggers responded with a shout that sounded
like one throat had made it.</p>

<p>Several times during the early part of the speech
Hels Helsen had attempted to interrupt Paul Bunyan,
but he was always silenced by the matchless eloquence
of the master orator. And when the loggers cheered
him he kept in his heart whatever he wanted to say; he
frowned and mumbled powerfully for a moment; but
then he grinned and obediently followed Paul Bunyan
into the camp office.</p>

<p>The virgin Dakota country of that time had what
was no doubt the most beautiful and unique scenic
feature in Real America. In the center of a forested
plain stood the largest and most original of all mountains,
the Mountain That Stood On Its Head. Its
peak was buried in the ground, and its slopes ran outward,
instead of in toward its summit. It was five
miles in a direct line from the head of the mountain
and up the slope to the rim of its foot; ascent would
seem impossible to any beholder, for a climber up the
mountain side would necessarily have to move with his
feet uppermost or else walk with his head. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
stubborn pine trees on the mountain sides had refused
to grow unnaturally; they had kept their roots in the
ground, and their tops all pointed downward. The
summit of the mountain (perhaps I should go on saying
“foot,” but this might prove confusing) was a
plain two miles above a plain, for it was flat and
heavily timbered with the noblest of close-grained
pine. This unnatural but wonderful mountain top
was in the form of a true circle which was one hundred
and twenty-seven miles in circumference. At
one place the rim of the circle rose gently, and a mild
slope ran away from it towards the center of the plain.
Here were the High Springs, whose waters formed
Lofty River and flowed smoothly through aisles of
pine and wound among meadows which were abloom
with mountain orchids and fragrant with purple
clover. The falls in which the river made its two
mile drop to the plain below had been named Niagara
by Paul Bunyan, to honor the memory of his old
moose hound, and the name was later passed on to a
little waterfall along the Border.</p>

<p>It was to this place of scenic grandeur that Paul
Bunyan now moved his camp. It was here that he
was determined to try out Hels Helsen and make him
prove his right to the title of Bull of the Woods. The
camp was put in order; the axmen and sawyers were
given their stations in the woods, trails were swamped
out for Babe, the big blue ox, to use in snaking the
logs to the landings, Hels Helsen was given final instructions.
Paul Bunyan then retired with a sigh to
his ledgers, and the logging began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>Paul Bunyan had figured that it would require two
seasons to log off Dakota; one season for the low
lands, and one for the mountain. But he did not
know Hels Helsen, the Big Swede. From the time
that he yelled, “Roll out or roll up!” on his first morning
in camp the loggers felt the urge of a new power
and they put a vigor and force into their work which
had been lacking for a long time. Not often did the
Bull of the Woods speak to them, but when he did
his roar made the loggers remember his title; and the
chips flew from the ax bits like leaves in a wind, and
the saws smoked as they flashed back and forth in the
tree trunks.</p>

<p>Logs piled up ahead of the blue ox, but Hels Helsen
remembering the tricks he had learned as a great man
with cattle in the old country, took the exuberant,
well-meaning creature in hand and taught him speed.
So active did Babe become that only Hels Helsen
could handle him. Each morning, eager to get to
work, he galloped madly for the woods, while the
foreman held grimly to the halter rope, thrown
from his feet very often, hurled through the air,
bounced over rocks and stumps, but holding fast always.</p>

<p>So rapidly did the logging go on that Paul Bunyan
could only accomplish the necessary figuring by giving
all of his time to it. He began to weary of his
hours at the desk, while his soul cried out for the
timber; he envied Hels Helsen for the ideal life he
was living, but he gladly gave him the honor and
glory that was his due. Latin Paul Bunyan praised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
his great Nordic foreman constantly and said nothing
of himself.</p>

<p>Now, as Paul Bunyan’s only physical weakness was
a ticklishness of the neck, so was his only mental weakness
extreme modesty. He never boasted, and he
never belittled the pretensions of his men by reminding
them of his own part in their achievements. Consequently,
his inventions were taken as a matter of
course, and his paperwork was not considered very
difficult by his loggers because they knew nothing
about it. His praise of Hels Helsen, and his reticence
about himself, naturally made his men exaggerate the
greatness of the Bull of the Woods and minimize the
importance of Paul Bunyan.</p>

<p>The effect on Hels Helsen was even more dangerous.
In the first place he had not come to Paul Bunyan
with the intention of seeking a foreman’s job; he
had wanted to propose a partnership between the
greatest man of Sweden and the greatest man of Real
America. But Paul Bunyan’s oratory had baffled him,
and he had taken the position without arguing for
what he considered his rightful place. However, a
resentment had been kindled in his soul; and with
his success as a foreman it flamed into an exalted
opinion of his own powers; as the time for logging
off the mountain approached he resolved to not only
make this enterprise bring him equality with Paul
Bunyan but a position of command over him. Therefore,
a terrible conflict was inevitable.</p>

<p>The first intimation that Paul Bunyan had of the
coming struggle was during the preparations for logging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
off the mountain. He himself had made many
plans for accomplishing the difficult job, taking time
from his office work to think them out. Then the first
drive was finished and the day came when felling was
to begin on the mountain side. On that morning
Paul Bunyan was about to call his foreman to give
him instructions when he heard the loggers marching
out of camp. Hels Helsen was taking them to the
woods; the foreman had seemed to think it unnecessary
to consult with Paul Bunyan. For a moment
the master of the camp had a raging impulse to take
after them and assert his authority, but his good sense
restrained him.</p>

<p>“There is no appetite more powerful than that for
the strong meat of authority,” Paul Bunyan always
told his bossmen. “But if you bite off more than
you can chew, nothing will choke you more surely.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan remembered this saying now, and he
thought it best to let Hels Helsen learn the lesson
for himself.</p>

<p>So for days he made no inquiries about the progress
of the work in the woods. He busied himself with
his figures and waited. He noted with secret pleasure
the bafflement and worry that showed in deeper
lines on Hels Helsen’s face each succeeding night.
The loggers were always utterly weary now when
they got into camp; at last many of them were too
exhausted to eat their pea soup when the day was
done; others went to sleep at the supper table, and
they would not awaken until breakfast time. Then
the first week’s scale was brought in, and it showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
only an average of one tree per man for each seventy-two
hours of labor. The master logger chuckled over
this, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, his accounts being in order,
he walked over the hump to where he could observe the
logging operations.</p>

<p>On the slopes—or under them, rather—of the
Mountain That Stood On Its Head crawled Hels
Helsen, and he was urging the loggers to follow him.
Not an original method had he devised; he was even
insisting that the loggers walk upside down and fell
the trees in exactly the same style that they used when
standing up. Having been a champion mountain
climber in Sweden, he got up the slopes without much
difficulty, and he strung cables between the trees.
Along these cables the loggers dizzily worked themselves.
Tree-felling even under ordinary conditions
is hard labor for the strongest men. But when a
woodsman attempts to operate a limber crosscut saw
and a heavy ax, his head down, his body hanging by
a leather belt which is fastened to a swaying cable;
when a woodsman looks up to see his feet and to have
dirt and sawdust fall down in his eyes; when a woodsman
looks down to see rocks and stumps a mile and a
half below him—brave and powerful though he may
be, a woodsman in such circumstances is bound to
feel inconvenienced, harassed and impeded in the performance
of his labor. And even the threatening roars
and the pleading bellows of a Hels Helsen, the
supreme and original Bull of the Woods, cannot make
him work efficiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>“The test of great leadership is originality,” mused
Paul Bunyan, as he returned to camp. “At least
some inventiveness is needed. Heroic Hels Helsen,
the Bull of the Woods—a fair title. The hero inspires,
but the thinker leads. I shall now think. One
great idea put into action can set the world afire.
Surely it will take no more than a common one to
master Hels Helsen.”</p>

<p>In such solemn ponderings Paul Bunyan spent the
rest of the day. Until midnight he thought, and then
the idea came. He at once went to work to make a
reality of it.</p>

<p>From an old chest that held the weapons and traps
of his pre-logging days he brought forth the most
prized weapon of his youth, a gold-butted, diamond-mounted,
double-barreled shot gun. He spent the
rest of the night in careful cleaning of all its parts.
An idea of the size and power of this super-cannon
can be gained when it is remembered that he used its
two barrels at a later time as smokestacks for his
first sawmill. The shells for it were made from the
largest cedar logs in the country; they were hollowed
out, bound with brass, and capped with sheet iron.</p>

<p>After breakfast, when the loggers had gone wearily
to their terrible labor, Paul Bunyan ordered Big Ole,
the blacksmith, to cut up thousands of pieces of sheet
iron, making each one two feet square. In two days
he had the shells loaded, and he was ready to try out
his idea. Then he waited for the time when Hels
Helsen would have to call on him for help. And
this time was sure to come soon, for as the work slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
moved up from the head of the mountain the unimaginative
logging methods of the stubborn Bull of
the Woods could not but fail completely. And Hels
Helsen was not the leader to change these methods
himself; he was only a hero.</p>

<p>But Paul Bunyan was not prepared for the monstrous
display of effrontery which was given by Hels
Helsen when the exhausted loggers could no longer
follow him up the mountain side.</p>

<p>One morning the foreman did not call the men out
to work; instead, Paul Bunyan heard him giving them
orders to pack up.</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” exclaimed the master logger.
“What means this, Hels?”</p>

<p>The Bull of the Woods was attaching a cable to the
cookhouse skids. He looked up with an insolent grin.</p>

<p>“Aye forgot tal you, Bunyan, but aye goin’ move
dar camp,” he said, in tones of marked disrespect.
“No use to try har no moore noo, aye tank. Logger
can’ stan’ on head mooch lonker har. Aye don’ tank
so, Bunyan. We move new yob noo.”</p>

<p>“Bunyan!” exploded the appalled leader. “‘Bunyan,’
you call me! You think <em>you’ll</em> move the camp!
<em>You</em> will do so! By the blazing sands of the hot
high hills of hell, and by the stink and steam of its
low swamp water, how in the name of the holy old
mackinaw, how in the names of the whistling old,
roaring old, jumping old, bald-headed, blue-bellied
jeem cris and the dod derned dod do you figure you’re
wearing any shining crown of supreme authority in
this man’s camp? Say!!!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>“Aye tank so,” said Hels Helsen calmly.</p>

<p>“Suffering old saints and bleary-eyed fathers!”</p>

<p>“Yah, aye tank so.”</p>

<p>With a mighty effort Paul Bunyan recovered his
poise and dignity. He strode to the office and got his
shot gun and a sack of shells loaded with sheet iron
squares. Then his “All out, men!” rolled through the
camp.</p>

<p>The power of that unloosed voice threw each logger
into the air, and they all dropped, bottoms down, on
the rocky ground. They were still dazed men as they
wabbled to their feet, and they meekly followed their
rightful leader toward the mountain, rubbing sore
spots with their hands as they staggered along. Muttering
darkly, Hels Helsen followed at a distance.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan halted the loggers before they reached
the shadows of the mountain. He turned and faced
them, and for a moment they stood in breathless
terror, fearing that he was going to urge them to another
effort on the slopes above. But no. Paul Bunyan
only said, in the tones of a gentle teacher, “You
see before you a logged-off plain. Only stumps remain
upon its soil. I shall make you a forest. Behold!”</p>

<p>He turned and lifted the shot gun to his shoulder
and pulled the triggers; both barrels went off in such
a violent explosion that many of the loggers again
tumbled to the ground. Clouds of dust dropped from
the mountain side and blanketed the plain. When the
wind had thinned out the fog the amazed loggers saw
the beginnings of a new forest before them. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
loads from the two shells had sheared off a thousand
trees; they had dropped straightly down and plunged
their tops into the plain. And there they stood, the
strangest grove ever seen by man. The small brushy
tops of the trees were imbedded in the ground, and
their huge bare trunks were swaying high in the air.
Before the loggers had recovered from their astonishment
at the sight Paul Bunyan was firing again; and
all that day the terrific explosions of his gun, and the
falling clouds of dust from the mountain addled the
loggers. At sundown he had completed the circuit
around the Mountain That Stood On Its Head; its
slopes were shorn of trees, and the plain underneath
once more had a forest. It was an amazing artificial
one, and the loggers doubted if they could get used
to it. But it promised easy logging, and when their
leader ordered them into camp they went singing. It
looked like the good old times were back.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Paul Bunyan to his foreman, “the idea
has mastered the material. I turn the job over to
you. Go to it in the morning. In the meantime,
I’ll invent a way to log off the foot of the mountain
which towers yonder among the clouds.”</p>

<p>Hels Helsen said nothing; but he scowled and
scratched his head.</p>

<p>In the morning Paul Bunyan was figuring briskly,
quite content again, when he noticed a stir in the camp
that was unusual for the late hour. He looked out
and saw the loggers wandering idly about. They
said that Hels Helsen had not ordered them to roll
out but had gone to the woods himself. Sensing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
a struggle was at hand for the dominance of the camp,
and realizing that the powerful and obtuse Hels
Helsen could only be conquered by physical force,
Paul Bunyan ordered his men to remain behind, and
he started after the foreman.</p>

<p>Hels Helsen was climbing the mountain when Paul
Bunyan reached the new forest, and he paid no heed
to the calls that were sent after him. The climber
had his shoes off, and he moved up swiftly by grasping
the largest stumps of the sheared trees with his fingers,
wrapping his toes around others and drawing himself
up like a rope climber. In a short time he reached
the rim and, throwing his leg over it, he drew himself
to the top. He rested for a moment, then he
stood up and began uprooting the close-grained white
pine trees, which extended scores of miles before
him. A tumult of rage swelled up in Paul Bunyan’s
heart. So Hels Helsen had rebelled and become an
independent logger. If competition had been necessary
to the logging industry the greatest logger himself
would have invented it. But he knew that
equality was an evil thing; a powerful rival was not
to be tolerated; for the sake of the grand new race
of loggers, if for nothing else, Hels Helsen must be
put in his proper place.</p>

<p>Wise even in wrath, Paul Bunyan did not attempt
to climb the mountain. He ran to a far point of the
plain, then he turned and rushed back with his greatest
speed. When he neared the mountain he leaped, he
struck the ground with his knees bending for a spring,
and then he threw himself upward in a tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
lunge. His upstretched hands brushed down the slope
and started a roaring avalanche. A large section of
the rim gave way, and now a large hill stood under
the broken edge of the mountain rim. Again Paul
Bunyan ran and leaped; this time he made his second
jump from the hilltop and his hands caught over a
cliff that jutted below the broken rim. Laboriously
he drew himself up, he thrust his foot over the top,
and after a struggle that sent more rocks and trees
crashing down upon the hill, he won to the plain and
lay resting for the battle.</p>

<p>A minute had not passed before he felt the mountain
shake, and when he rolled over he saw Hels
Helsen rushing upon him. The Big Swede’s blue
eyes flashed like hot polished steel, the gritting of his
teeth sounded like the grind of a rock crusher, his hat
was off and his yellow bristles stuck up like tall ripe
grain on a squat hill. The pine trees rocked and
creaked from the wind of his swinging fists. The
mighty Paul Bunyan sprang to his feet and received
the furious charge as a cliff of solid rock receives the
smash of a tidal wave....</p>

<p>The loggers in camp heard a stupendous uproar
of battle, and they fled from the shaking bunkhouses.
The bravest among them crawled to the top of the
hump, from where they could see the mountain.
When they beheld the titanic conflict that was raging
two miles above them on the flat mountain top they
stood like images of stone and stared affrightedly.
Around and around the one hundred and twenty-seven
mile circle of the lofty plain the leader and the foreman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
fought with all their powers. Now came a
sound like a thunder-clap as Paul Bunyan smote Hels
Helsen solidly on his square jaw. Now came a sound
like a hurricane screeching through a network of
cables as Hels Helsen’s hand seized Paul Bunyan’s
beard and was jerked loose. For a long time the
struggle seemed equal, with neither combatant suffering
great injury. Then Paul Bunyan’s shoulders
struck acres of pine trees with the crash of a tornado.
A heaving mass of dust rolled over him, but the dauntless
leader’s head was suddenly thrust above it; the
loggers saw his fist fly from behind him, it squashed
over Hels Helsen’s nose, and the sun shone red through
a spray of blood.... Balloons and geysers of dust
now rose explosively all over the mountain top, and
heavy gray clouds soon hid the mountain from view;
trees and rocks crashed everywhere on the plain below;
the convulsions of the earth increased in force; even
the bravest of the loggers were at last terrified by the
shocks and blasts, and they fled to camp and hid under
their blankets.</p>

<p>All night the tumult of battle sounded, but at
dawn there was a crash of such shocking force that
it upset every bunkhouse; and then a sudden hush.
The loggers, all shell-shocked and bruised, crawled
under their overturned bunks, but as the quiet persisted
they at length ventured outside. The dust was
still rolling by in thick clouds and they could not
see their hands before them. But at sunup it had
thinned out, and ere long they beheld the figure of one
of the fighters looming in the distance. The conqueror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
was carrying his helpless adversary over his shoulder.</p>

<p>And this conqueror, this victor in that tourney of
the Titans, that battle of the behemoths, that riot of
the races, that Herculean jaw-hammering, chin-mauling,
nose-pounding, side-stamping, cheek-tearing,
rib-breaking, lip-pinching, back-beating, neck-choking,
eye-gouging, tooth-jerking, arm-twisting, head-butting,
beard-pulling, ear-biting, bottom-thumping, toe-holding,
knee-tickling, shin-cracking, heel-bruising,
belly-whacking, hair-yanking, hell-roaring supreme
and incomparable knock-down-and-drag-out fight of
all history was the mighty leader of the new race of
loggers, Battling Paul Bunyan.</p>

<p>Tattered, bloody, dirt-streaked, he marched with
dignity still. On through the hosts of silent awed
loggers he passed, without glancing down at them.
He disappeared with the Bull of the Woods into the
camp office.</p>

<p>“You’re going to be a good foreman now, Hels
Helsen!”</p>

<p>“Aye tank so, Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>“You <em>know</em> so, Hels Helsen.”</p>

<p>“Yah, Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>And no more was said.</p>

<p>The wonderful mountain was gone, alas; the
struggle had demolished it and scattered its majesty
in dust over the plain. To-day the Northern winds
blow down over the desolate remains of that once
noble and marvelous eminence—the remains of blood-darkened
dust which are now known as the Black Hills
of Dakota.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_51">A MATTER OF HISTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Three</span> weeks after his cataclysmic fist fight with his
foreman, Hels Helsen, Paul Bunyan was up and
around, thinking of his next move. Dakota, once a
great timberland, was now a brown, barren country;
its logs and stumps had been covered with blankets of
dust when the Mountain That Stood On Its Head
was destroyed, and the mountain itself was now only
clusters of black hills. The greatest logging camp
of all history was situated in a vacant prairie. It
was preposterous.</p>

<p>But the mighty logger did not revile fate, nor did
he lift his voice in lamentations. Neither did he have
words of condemnation for the belligerent audacity
of the Big Swede, who, chastened and meek in defeat,
now gazed worshipfully on his conqueror. Still
wearing the bruises and scars of battle, he limped
around his bunk a few times and then said mildly:</p>

<p>“Aye tank aye soon be back on yob noo, Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>“We have no job now. There is no timber within
hundreds of miles of us.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan shook his head sadly; but presently
consoling thoughts came to him, and then proud
joy flashed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“But what does the ruin of a season’s logging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
matter?” he said cheerily. “We have made history;
and that is what matters. After all, industry is bunk;
making history is the true work of the leader-hero.
And this fight of ours was the first dramatic historical
event since the Winter of the Blue Snow. This idea
would be a great consolation to you also, but you lack
imagination.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” said the Big Swede humbly. “Aye yust
wan’ yob, Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>“And a job you shall have,” said Paul Bunyan with
great heartiness. “We will move at once to—but
that is something to be thought about. Wherever we
go you shall have full command over the blue ox.
And, next to myself, you shall be in command over the
loggers. Now that there is peace and understanding
between us we can perform impossible labors.”</p>

<p>For several hours the great logger talked on, and
there was more of enthusiasm than of purpose in his
speech, for he was still shaken from the knocks and
strokes the Big Swede had given him three weeks before.
The foreman went to sleep at length, but all
night Paul Bunyan was wakeful with troublous fancies
and bright but insubstantial ideas. In the morning,
when his mind was calmer and his thoughts more
orderly, only one of the notions that had come to him
seemed worth while. This was the idea of a double
drive, one under his direction, and one in the charge
of the Big Swede, but both of them side by side. It
should make a unique race. There was some stuff of
history in the idea.</p>

<p>So Paul Bunyan determined to forget the Dakota<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Disaster and make practical preparations for the new
achievement at once. First, he inspected the bunkhouses
and found that the loggers had set them up
and repaired the bunks. Next, he examined the cookhouse,
and he saw to his pleasure, that the cooks had
it clean of dust and that pea soup was once more bubbling
on the stoves. Babe, the big blue ox, was suffering
from hayfever, and he sneezed dolefully at long
intervals, but the old eager, jovial look was in his
eyes; they shone like blue moons when Paul Bunyan
looked him over.</p>

<p>Satisfied, the master logger returned to his office.
He found the Big Swede on his feet, and there was
only a slight limp in his walk this morning. It looked
indeed like good luck was returning, and Paul Bunyan
thought of the double drive with great hope. In a
splendid good humor he jested with his foreman as
he opened his roll-top desk to examine his papers.
But the great logger’s merriment was quickly hushed
as the desk top rolled up and a frightful sight was
revealed. The shock of battle had shaken the ink
barrels into pieces, and the shelf on which they stood
was now covered with a black mass of broken staves.
Below were his ledgers. In dismay Paul Bunyan
pulled them out and opened them. Nearly every
page was wet and black, and the old figures were almost
illegible. The Ledgers from 1 to 7, for example,
seemed to be entirely ruined. Ledger No. 1111 had
black pages up to page 27,000, and its other sheets
were badly smeared. Even Ledger 10,000, the last
one in the row, had streaks and daubs on most of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
sheets, and only the last 3,723 pages remained unstained.
Paul Bunyan was appalled, and only his
brave heart could have kept courage in such discouraging
circumstances.</p>

<p>He wished to be alone, so he gave the Big Swede
instructions to groom the blue ox and trim his hooves.
When the foreman was gone, Paul Bunyan sat down,
and, having dug a young pine tree out of the earth, he
began to brush his beard and ponder.</p>

<p>The damage done to his precious records was a
terrible blow, and he thought first of how he might
repair it. As he had said, his main desire was to make
history; his imagination rose above mere industry.
His records contained the history of all his operations,
even to their most minute details, and if no one could
read them his work up to the present time was all
wasted. The loss of his grand history was, to Paul
Bunyan’s mind, the most terrible part of the Dakota
Disaster. But his loggers, of course, were only interested
in their work; and the Big Swede, too, was
now anxious to show his conqueror that he would be
an obedient, efficient foreman on the next job. It
was Paul Bunyan’s duty to find a good one for them,
and one that would make a fitting beginning for a
new history also. Resolving to devote his energies
solely to realizing this hope, he shook off regret and
forced a smile and a jest.</p>

<p>“It is no use crying over spilled ink,” he said.</p>

<p>So he put the old ledgers away in the chest which
held his souvenirs, and he brought out a set of new
ones. In them his new records should be made, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
future history written. It should be an account of
splendid deeds and give him enough glory. He found
many gladdening thoughts, and when he gave orders
for a move he showed his men the same cheerful face
that they had always known.</p>

<p>The loggers hustled and bustled, and in a short time
the camp buildings were lined up and fastened together.
The grand cookhouse was put in the lead,
Babe was hitched to its skids, and Paul Bunyan and
the Big Swede took stations in front of him. “Yay,
Babe!” the leader said, and the move began.</p>

<p>Happy were the loggers as the camp flew over the
prairie, though not one of them knew where it was
going. All were certain, of course, that they were
headed for some vast timberland where great logging
could be enjoyed. They supposed that Paul Bunyan
planned a surprise for them, as he had not given his
usual graphic and prophetic speech before the start
was made. The word was passed along that the new
job was too wonderful to tell about. But this was
only part of the truth. Paul Bunyan’s mind was indeed
filled with the idea of a unique double drive,
but he did not yet know where the project could be
carried out. A wide, gentle river with timber on both
sides of it was needed; and once found, he would have
to use his inventiveness to the utmost in order to divide
the stream so that two drives could be made side by
side on it.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan traveled far with his camp in search
of the ideal river. Powder River looked promising
at first; it was a mile wide, but then it was only a foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
deep. It deepened and got narrow in one place, but
this was only a deceitful twist of the stream, for it
presently turned and ran on its edge for the rest of its
course, its waters a mile deep and a foot wide. Hot
River, in the Boiling Springs country, flowed placidly
and honestly enough all its way, but it was of a temperature
to scald the calks off the loggers’ boots. And
Wild River, though it was a white water stream, would
have served for a double drive; but it was alive with
cougarfish, a species resembling the catfish of the
Mississippi; but the cougarfish were larger and incomparably
more savage and had claws on their tails.
Careful Paul Bunyan would not risk his loggers
among them.</p>

<p>At last the master logger had only one hope left.
It lay in the Twin Rivers country. Twin Rivers
were ideal for a double drive, as they were two
fat streams which flowed lazily, smoothly, and side
by side through a wide valley. But that country was
the scene of Paul Bunyan’s first logging; it was there
that he had invented the industry; and, having no
loggers then, he had uprooted trees by handfuls to
get his logs. Consequently, second growth timber was
not to be hoped for in the greater part of that region.
In the lower part of the Twin Rivers valley there
might be some new timber, for there Paul Bunyan had
taught the blue ox the art of skidding; and he had
sheared off most of the trees instead of uprooting
them. No doubt there were some new trees on this
land, but most of the logs for a double drive on Twin
Rivers would have to be procured elsewhere. How
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>he was to get them he did not know. But he was
staunch and inflexible in his determination to make the
second event of his new history a tremendously successful
one.</p>

<figure id="ip_57" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35em;">
  <img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="1357" height="1199" alt="cougarfish"></figure>

<p>So Babe was turned toward the Twin Rivers
country, and in a few hours the loggers were getting
glimpses of familiar scenes as the bunkhouses sailed
over stump-covered valleys and hills. They still had
no word of Paul Bunyan’s intentions, and they were
astonished when, at nightfall, the camp was halted
at the upper end of Twin Rivers valley and they were
told that here was to be their camping place for the
season.</p>

<p>There was no moon this night, and from the bunkhouses
nothing of the country could be seen except
Twin Rivers, which showed surfaces of blurred, tarnished
gray in the darkness; they looked like two
wide, lonely roads with a tall black hedge between
them. Heavy grass was discovered around the camp
buildings, but there was no indication anywhere of
timber, or even of brush. But the loggers were too
tired to wonder; they had been riding for two days
behind the blue ox, who could outrun a cyclone, and
they were thankful for the chance to rest and sleep.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan lay in his camp office and listened
to the peaceful snores of the Big Swede, who could
sleep so well because he lacked imagination. But the
great logger’s thoughts and visions banished any hope
of rest for him. Work should begin at once, and a
great idea must precede it. His determination for
the double drive was solidly fixed; he <em>would</em> get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
good plan for it. Now then: first, for a drive there
must be logs; next, for logs there must be trees; then,
for trees there must be timberland, as trees cannot be
conjured from nothingness. Now, all around him
was nothing but logged-off land; perhaps it would be
possible to invent a way to log off logged-off land....
Thunderation! what preposterous notions he
was getting! But all his ideas seemed to be as absurd.
As the night hours crawled slowly on Paul Bunyan
began to doubt his powers. Had the fight with the
Big Swede left him a little crazy? Perhaps. At
dawn his mind was in a turmoil; he felt that he had
brought himself face to face with the supreme crisis
of his career, and it looked like he was not to meet it
successfully. If so, the meanest swamper in camp
would despise him. And the Big Swede—how soon
he would lose the humble worship that Paul Bunyan
had pounded into him and be filled with a cold
Nordic scorn for this Latin victim of imagination!...
What was wrong with his ideas? Why didn’t
they swell with their usual superb force and burst into
a splendor of magnificent plans? Was this new history
of logging, then, to be a history of failure?...</p>

<p>In a torment of thought, Paul Bunyan could lie still
no longer. Darkness was passing fast now; he threw
off his blankets and tramped to the office door. He
drew it open, then—motionless, unblinking, breathless—he
stared for sixty-six minutes. At last he
rubbed his eyes; but then he again stared as woodenly
as a heathen idol. He could only believe that his
rebellious imagination was deceiving him, that the incredible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
sight before him was certainly unreal. For
he saw trees everywhere; on both sides of the river they
reached to the horizon.</p>

<p>They were in exact rows, like trees in an orchard,
and each one was a large, smooth, untapering column,
flat-topped and without a trace of bark or boughs.
Again and again Paul Bunyan rubbed his eyes, thinking
to see the strange forest vanish. But it remained,
and he rushed out at last and seized one of the trees.
He pulled it up easily, and he was more amazed than
ever, for it had a sharp point instead of roots. He
walked on out into the forest and pulled up others
here and there, and they were all exactly alike in shape
and size.</p>

<p>So delighted was Paul Bunyan with his miraculous
good fortune that for a long time he only walked back
and forth among the rows of Pine Orchard—for so he
named the forest,—and every moment he found some
new feature of it that was wonderful and enchanting.
For one thing, he could walk through it without difficulty,
as there was room between the rows for one of
his feet. He saw that no tedious swamping would be
required for the logging-off of this forest—no cutting
of brush and trimming of limbs. It would be unnecessary
to build the usual trails for the blue ox. As
the logs would all be of like size, driving them down
the rivers would be play for his men.</p>

<p>At last he tramped back to camp and called the loggers
out of the bunkhouses. They came forth groaning
and yawning, but when they saw Pine Orchard
they too were tremendously enthusiastic about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
beautiful logging it offered, and some of them got their
axes and saws and began felling at once. The trees
were as tall and as large as the medium trees in an
ordinary pine forest, but acres of them had been
notched and sawn off when the breakfast gong rang.
Paul Bunyan, with a cyclonic sigh of relief and content
retired to the office to do the first figuring for the
new history.</p>

<p>Logging went on at a record-breaking rate during
the late summer; early autumn passed, and the loggers
still felt that they were enjoying the happiest
work of their careers. The Big Swede seemed perfectly
contented with his position now; his gentleness
and patience with the blue ox could not be surpassed,
and he bossed the felling crews efficiently when Paul
Bunyan had to leave them to toil over the new ledgers.
The great logger himself had not been happier in years,
for the logs being all of a size made the figuring simple
now, and he spent all but three hours a day in the
woods.</p>

<p>With the coming of the snapping frosts of late
autumn the operations had reached the lower part of
the Twin Rivers valley, and the smooth, bare trees of
Pine Orchard were all piled neatly along the banks of
the stream. Now the second growth of regular pine
trees was reached, and the work of limbing, bucking
and swamping again became part of the loggers’
duties. But they were fat and saucy from their easy
months in Pine Orchard, and the first day’s felling in
the old-fashioned forest brought down a record number
of trees. However, it also brought more figuring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
for Paul Bunyan, for he now had to keep accounts of
a thousand sizes and lengths of logs. This kept him
from the woods, though the Big Swede really needed
him now because of the problems which develop incessantly
in regular logging. Again Paul Bunyan
came to feel the need of a great figurer, recorder and
secretary; but where was one to be found who had both
the size and knowledge to care for his vast bookkeeping
system and enormous history books? It was folly
to hope for such a man, so Paul Bunyan stuck bravely
to his desk and made the best of his situation.</p>

<p>And the logging went on without many discouraging
incidents until one morning in November. Then
Paul Bunyan looked out and saw that the Twin River
next to the camp had risen six feet, though the other
Twin was at its normal level. Wondering at the unnatural
flood and fearing for the logs piled on the
landings, the leader-hero set out at a great pace to discover
what was obstructing the flow of the Left Twin.
Where the river curved around a cliff he saw what
appeared to be a boot as large as his own; it was resting
in the stream, and, as it reached from the cliff to
the bank between the Twin Rivers it made a perfect
dam, and the river had not yet risen to the top of it.
Paul Bunyan’s gaze traveled up the bootleg and
reached a corduroyed knee; then he saw that a remarkable
figure was seated on the cliff, the figure
of a man who was nearly as large as the master
logger.</p>

<p>Remembering the danger to his logs, Paul Bunyan
seized the foot that was damning the river and lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
it without ceremony. The released waters boiled and
thundered as they rolled on, but above the roar Paul
Bunyan heard a voice, soft and mild for all its power,
saying, “I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>The master logger could not restrain an exclamation
of delight.</p>

<p>“Educated! By the holy old mackinaw!”</p>

<p>He pulled aside the trees from which the grand
gentlemanly voice had issued. There sat a man.
And such a man!</p>

<p>His long but well-combed hair was level with the
tree tops, though he was seated among them. Some
black, straight strands of hair fell over a forehead of
extraordinary height, a forehead which was marked
with deep, grave wrinkles. His black eyebrows resembled
nothing so much as fishhooks, breaking down
sharply at his nose. His large, pale eyes looked
through old-fashioned spectacles. His nose was original;
it sloped out to an astonishing length, and a piece
of rubber the size of a barrel was pinched over the
end of it. He was certainly an educated man. He
wore a necktie, for one thing; yes, and there were
papers resting on one raised knee; in his right hand
was a pencil, and many others were behind his ears.
Now he was figuring with incredible speed; then he
thrust the rubber in his nose against the paper, shook
his head three times and the sheet was clean.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan wanted to shout and jig like a school-boy,
so jubilant was his logger’s soul made by the
sight of this marvelous man. Here was the one person
who was needed to make his camp a perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
organized industry, to guarantee the success of his
plans to become a maker of history. By hook or
crook he must have him.</p>

<p>He tapped the engrossed figurer on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Paul Bunyan, the master logger, the maker of history
and inventor of note, the only living Real American
leader-hero of industry, addresses you,” he said
impressively.</p>

<p>“I have heard of you,” said the other, extending his
hand but not rising. “I am John Rogers Inkslinger,
the master figurer, the one and only Real American
surveyor. But you must excuse me now, for I am endeavoring
to solve the one problem that has ever
baffled me. I have been working on it steadily for
two months, and still the answer evades me.”</p>

<p>He at once began figuring again, and Paul Bunyan,
a little awed, had no words to say at that moment.
He had no idea of what a surveyor might be, and he
feared that John Rogers Inkslinger was something
greater than himself. He would find out. So he
said:</p>

<p>“I am a figurer also, though not a great one. Yet
I might help you. What is your problem?”</p>

<p>“I am looking for Section 37,” said John Rogers
Inkslinger.</p>

<p>“Section 37?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have only found thirty-six sections in each
of the townships which I have surveyed here. There
should be thirty-seven.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan was delighted that he could solve the
problem so easily. “When I first logged off lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Twin Rivers valley,” he said, “I had no logging crews,
but only Babe, my big blue ox. The method I used
was to hitch Babe to a section of timber—this ox of
mine, Mr. Inkslinger, can pull anything that man can
walk on—, snake it to the river, shear off the trees,
and then haul the logged off land back to its place.
I handled a township a week in this fashion; but I always
left Section 37 in the river on Saturday night,
and the stream would wash it away. Now I judge
that you survey the land as I measured it; consequently,
you have only found thirty-six sections in
each township.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” cried John Rogers Inkslinger
admiringly. “I should have looked you up before.
But I supposed you were an ordinary man of the forests.
You would certainly make a great surveyor.
You must leave this common life you are leading and
come with me. Together we will soon have every
section of land in the country staked out perfectly.”</p>

<p>“I have a different idea,” said Paul Bunyan.</p>

<p>Whereupon he unloosed his eloquence, and for the
rest of the day his richest phrases were lavished on the
surveyor. And this man, sure of the greatness of his
own accomplishments, listened with strong doubts for
a long time. But at last he was convinced that logging
was the greatest of all occupations and that Paul
Bunyan towered far above him as a hero.</p>

<p>“I can only think of you with awe and admiration,”
he said at last. “But I have my own work, inconsequential
as it now seems. So I cannot become your
figurer at present. Think, Mr. Bunyan, of Real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
America’s uncharted rivers, her unstaked plains, her
unplumbed lakes! It is my mission <span class="locked">to—to——”</span></p>

<p>His speech ended in a yell of fright as a monstrous
red tongue was thrust before his eyes; it passed moistly
over his face, it rolled oozily behind his ear; then he
heard a “moo” that was as loud as muffled thunder, but
affectionate and kind. The surveyor wiped his face
and his spectacles and turned fearfully to see Babe,
the ox whose hair was blue as the sky, gazing at him,
with a pleading tenderness in his bulging eyes.</p>

<p>“Even Babe wants you to come with us,” said
Paul Bunyan, his beard shaking in a chuckle. “Such
a powerful argument. Now what in <span class="locked">thunderation——”</span></p>

<p>John Rogers Inkslinger had let out a scream of
horror that sent Babe galloping back through the
timber.</p>

<p>“My instruments!” cried he. “Your infernal
clumsy ox has trampled them and demolished every
one. What misfortune!” He jumped to his feet and
began looking for his books and papers.</p>

<p>“Gone!” raged the surveyor. “That blue devil has
eaten them! All of my records, the history of my
works—gone! gone! gone! Eaten by an ox! His
four stomachs are crammed with them! Gone! gone!
gone!”</p>

<p>“Stop that caterwauling,” said Paul Bunyan impatiently.
“When my ledgers were ruined, I simply
observed, ‘There is no use crying over spilled ink.’
The hero is even more heroic in disaster than in triumph.
Be true to your pretensions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>“Pretensions, the devil!” said John Rogers Inkslinger
peevishly. “If you had the true figurer’s soul
you would give me your sympathy instead of unconsoling
platitudes.”</p>

<p>Then the tears began to fall from his eyes and made
great splashes in the river. Paul Bunyan, saying no
more, grasped his arm and marched him toward the
camp. The two heroes walked silently until they were
out of the timber and had started over the country
where Pine Orchard had stood.</p>

<p>Then Paul Bunyan said conversationally, “I found
a very original forest here. But it offered splendid
logging.... Thunderation again! What ails you
anyway?”</p>

<p>For John Rogers Inkslinger had once more burst
into yells of agony.</p>

<p>“My stakes!” he cried. “My surveyor’s stakes!
Two years’ work ruined, utterly ruined! The stakes
that marked my section lines—you have felled them
all and dragged them all to the rivers for logs! My
stakes that were to have stood forever—gone! gone!
gone!”</p>

<p>He choked and gasped, he clutched wildly at
nothingness, and then he fainted into the appalled
logger’s arms....</p>

<p>That winter was the only period of his career in
which Paul Bunyan knew the affliction of a guilty
conscience. It was true that he had not injured the
great surveyor willfully, but the fact that he had destroyed
another man’s work could not be ignored. He
had done irreparable damage and for the peace of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
soul he must somehow make amends, devise consolations
and give heart balm and recompense. He only
asked that the surveyor make any demand of him, that
he give him any opportunity to do a service that would
make up for the loss.</p>

<p>But the winter long John Rogers Inkslinger brooded
in the back room of the office and would speak to no
one. Each day regret bore heavier on Paul Bunyan’s
generous heart; Christmas was a time of deep gloom
for him; and when the first sunshine of spring brightened
the valley, even the approach of the great double
drive did not cheer him. He had abandoned his
ledgers, and he spent all of his time in the woods; he
had no wish to record the destruction of the surveyor’s
work.</p>

<p>The double drive was a huge success, and the rivermen
returned from it singing the praises of Paul Bunyan,
who had bested his foreman in the grand race.
But the great logger himself had only cheerless
thoughts as he came to the camp office. Another
move must now be made, and the sad business of repaying
John Rogers Inkslinger must be attended to
at last. He would place his camp and crew, his foreman
and the great blue ox, himself and all his august
talents unreservedly at the surveyor’s disposal.
Better long years of surveying than to leave this blot
on his history. It would be wretched work for him
and his men, he mused unhappily, as he opened the
office door, but he could not oppose conscience. His
mind formed the words of a contrite, submissive
speech, he tramped on into the office and prepared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
utter them; then out of the back room rushed John
Rogers Inkslinger; his eyes were shining, his face was
flushed with happiness, his hands were raised as
though in appeal.</p>

<p>“Paul Bunyan, greatest of Real Americans!” he
cried. “I have read your histories, and in the pages
of them I have learned the grandeur and glory of your
deeds, the extent and influence of your power, the
might of your mind! I now know your inventiveness,
your heroism, your majestic thoughts, your generous
heart! To think that I roared about Paul Bunyan
using my miserable stakes! And still you smile upon
me! Oh, Glory! I beg pardon humbly and ask
only to serve you henceforth in your <span class="locked">enterprises——”</span></p>

<p>“Here now,” said Paul Bunyan, dumfounded, incredulous
of his hearing, greatly embarrassed. “How
could you have read my ink-soaked ledgers?”</p>

<p>John Rogers Inkslinger answered him by bringing
out one of the volumes and opening it. On the black
pages were figures and letters of white; with white ink
the great figurer had painstakingly traced out the old
dimmed entries, and now every volume was as readable
as it had ever been.</p>

<p>“There!” he declaimed. “There, Mr. Bunyan, is
the proof of my worth and zeal. I found the ledgers,
and when you were on the drive I traced out their
messages. From them I learned to worship you.
Give me a desk and let me serve you as well hereafter.”</p>

<p>Overcome by emotion, Paul Bunyan turned and
stared unseeingly at the lands which had once been
Pine Orchard. Visions of tremendous accomplishments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
swept before him; he now had the perfect
organization he had always dreamed about, and there
could be no good reason for another failure. But he
had a new responsibility also; he was now more deeply
in debt to this man than ever. For, even as his fists
and feet had won him the faith and loyalty of the
Big Swede, so had his mind and heart, as revealed in
his history, won the extravagant devotion of the greatest
figurer. Only mighty works would keep it. Well,
he should not fail. Resolutely he faced the unfortunate
surveyor, the restorer of ruined accounts, the man
who should win fame with him as the greatest figurer
of all time.</p>

<p>“Timekeeper Johnny Inkslinger,” he said, “shake
hands.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_70">THE SOURDOUGH DRIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Political</span> campaigns remind old loggers of the violent
debate that once raged between Paul Bunyan,
the originator of the lumber industry, and his timekeeper,
Johnny Inkslinger. This debate was strictly
about business, however, for there was no politics in
those days. It was poor policy, argued the timekeeper,
to increase the varieties and quantities of edibles
grown on Paul Bunyan’s great farm simply to
make more stuffing for the loggers. He recommended
that the camp rations be cut down and that ships be
built, in which surplus farm produce could be shipped
to European markets. Johnny Inkslinger was the
original efficiency expert and he had hordes of figures
at hand to support his arguments. Paul Bunyan listened
with his usual calm and dignity, brushing his
beard with a fresh pine tree and nodding gravely, until
the timekeeper began to insist that the loggers could
do their work well enough on pea soup and sourdough
biscuits; then the great man erupted.</p>

<p>“Good glory, Johnny!” he exclaimed. “Have you
forgotten the Sourdough Drive?”</p>

<p>“I have not, Mr. Bunyan,” Inkslinger retorted
spiritedly. “But I have figures which show you
should have handled it differently.”</p>

<p>“The hell you have!” roared Paul Bunyan, in rare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
tones of anger. “Damn figures and figuring men!”</p>

<p>“And damn a man who damns figures!” thundered
Johnny Inkslinger, himself getting angry.</p>

<p>Whereupon Paul Bunyan damned him again in return,
and they kept up a furious argument until the
trees began to fall among the bunkhouses. The sourdough
drive was a subject that tormented Paul Bunyan’s
feelings whenever he thought of it; it was always
a sore spot with him. But when he heard the trees
tumbling down in the valley he remembered his dignity
and he silenced his timekeeper with a majestic gesture.
Then he gave instructions for a Sunday feast so huge
and diversified that Hot Biscuit Slim, the chief cook,
went into a solemn trance of joy upon receiving the
order. The timekeeper could not hide his mortification,
and Paul Bunyan clapped him on the shoulder,
saying cheerily, “There, there, my lad. You live in
a world of figures. I could not expect you to know
the soul of the born woodsman. But treasure this always:
a logging crew works on its stomach.”</p>

<p>After Paul Bunyan had invented logging and
brought hosts of little loggers over to Real America
to fell trees and drive logs down the rivers, his most
baffling problem sprang from the fact that little loggers
could not live on raw moose meat as he did.
They required cooked food; consequently Paul Bunyan
was compelled to build a cookhouse and import
cooks. His first cookhouse was a crude affair without
any notable mechanical equipment. And his first
cooks were men without talent or experience. But
Paul Bunyan’s loggers were hardy men whose appetites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
had never been pampered, and no one complained
of the camp fare until Pea Soup Shorty took
command of the cookhouse.</p>

<p>Pea Soup Shorty was a plump, lazy, complacent
rascal, and he made no attempt to feed the loggers
anything but hard-tack and pea soup. He even made
lunches for them by freezing pea soup around a rope
and sending the loggers’ lunches out to them in sticks
like big candles. Even then the loggers did not complain
greatly. Not until the winter in the Bullfrog
Lake country were they heard to cry out against their
food. That winter Shagline Bill’s freight sleds
broke the ice on the lake, and the season’s supply of
split peas was lost in the water. Pea Soup Shorty
did not try to originate any new food for the loggers;
he simply boiled the lake water and served it
to them for pea soup. Then the bunkhouse cranks
began to growl; and finally all the loggers revolted
against Pea Soup Shorty; and they declared against
pea soup also. Paul Bunyan had to look for another
kitchen chief. Old Sourdough Sam was his selection.</p>

<p>The Bunyan histories tell that Sourdough Sam made
everything but coffee out of sourdough. This substance
is really fermented dough, having the rising
qualities of yeast. It is said to be an explosive.
Modern camp cooks are always at great pains to warn
the new kitchen help away from the sourdough bowl,
telling them of the sad accident of Sourdough Sam,
who had his left arm and right leg blown off in an explosion
of the dangerous concoction.</p>

<p>The old cook brought this misfortune on himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Sourdough was his weakness as well as his strength.
Had he been content to keep it only in the kitchen,
where it belonged, and to develop it simply as a
food, he, and not his son, Hot Biscuit Slim, might
be remembered as the father of camp cookery, even
as the mighty Paul Bunyan is venerated as the
father of logging. But Sam was prey to wild
ideas about the uses of his creation. He declared
it could be used for shaving soap, poultices, eye
wash, boot grease, hair tonic, shin plasters, ear muffs,
chest protectors, corn pads, arch supporters, vest lining,
pillow stuffing, lamp fuel, kindling, saw polish
and physic. One time he came into the bunkhouse
with a chair cushion made out of sourdough. As bad
luck would have it, Jonah Wiles, the worst of the
bunkhouse cranks, was the first man to sit on it. He
always sat hard, and when he dropped on the new
chair cushion, he splashed sourdough as high as his
ears. Jonah Wiles was fearfully proud of his mackinaw
pants, for they were the only pair in camp that
had red, green, purple and orange checks. Now the
bursted cushion was splashed over all their gaudy
colors. Sam apologized humbly and begged the privilege
of washing them. His rage showing only in the
glitter of his beady blue eyes, Jonah Wiles stripped off
the smeared pants and handed them over to the cook.
Sourdough Sam recklessly washed them in another of
his creations, sourdough suds. Not a thread of color
was left in the prized pants; they were a brilliant
white when they were returned. The old cook brought
them back reluctantly and he was tremendously relieved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
when Jonah Wiles did not tear into him with
oaths and blows. But Jonah Wiles was different
from other loggers in that he always concealed even his
strongest feelings. So he put on the pants without
saying a word, though he was blazing with wrath inside.
His rage against the cook was aggravated when
his mates began to call him “the legless logger,” because
of his invisibility from the bottom of his coat to
the tops of his boots when he tramped to work. The
brilliant white pants did not show at all against a
background of snow.</p>

<p>This unfortunate incident led to the important
happenings of the Sourdough Drive, which was one
of the turning points in the history of logging. For
Jonah Wiles now cherished a vicious hostility against
Sourdough Sam; with patient cunning he awaited the
time when he might be avenged for the outrage that
had made him known in the camp as “the legless
logger.”</p>

<p>Jonah Wiles was not a great man among the loggers;
he was only a swamper, and Mark Beaucoup,
who was a mighty man with both ax and pike pole,
was much more to be feared as a bunkhouse crank.
But where Mark Beaucoup was a roaring grouch,
Jonah Wiles was a sly, quiet one; he had a devilish
insinuating gift of making men see and believe uncomfortable
things.</p>

<p>“Too bad yer so hoarse to-night,” he would say to
a bunkhouse bard who had just finished a song. “I’m
thinkin’ we’re needin’ more blankets. Ol’ Paul’ll let
us all freeze to death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>He would lead the bard to think he <em>did</em> have a
hoarseness, the bunkhouse gayety would vanish and a
seed of resentment would be sown against the master
logger. Before his pants were ruined Jonah Wiles
had never found a grievance which would serve to keep
his instinct of revolt always inflamed. But now his
misfortune was in his mind constantly. Without
openly attacking the culinary methods and creations
of Sourdough Sam, he slyly made a terrible shape of
them for his bunkhouse mates.</p>

<p>“Poor ol’ Sam,” he would say, drawing his lean,
gray face into an expression of pity. “Poor ol’ Sam.
He cooks the best he knows how, maybe. But I’m
afeard that sourdough uh his’n ’ll bring us all to an
ontimely end, fin’ly.”</p>

<p>Let a logger complain of corns, and Jonah Wiles
would remark that he had never heard of corns in the
woods before sourdough was invented. He insinuated
that everything from ingrown nails and bunions
to toothache and falling hair was due to the loggers’
sourdough meals. Ere long old Sam was met with
silence and bitter looks when he visited the bunkhouses
to show a new use of sourdough. And the loggers’
appetites fell away; one month after the accident to
Jonah Wiles’ pants, Johnny Inkslinger joyfully reported
to Paul Bunyan that the consumption of flour
and soda had been cut in half. The great logger
frowned; he had already learned much about the need
his men had for good food rightly cooked, though it
was no necessity for him.</p>

<p>“But I can’t consider this business, now,” he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
ruefully. “We’ve got to get this country logged off
before the water drops in Redbottom Lake. When
the spring drive is finished we’ll settle the feeding
problem once and for all time.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he thrust a bundle of sharpened axes
and two score new crosscut saws into his pocket, and,
followed by his timekeeper, he strode for the woods to
lay out the work for the next day. Jonah Wiles was
then in the kitchen with Sourdough Sam. Paul Bunyan
and his timekeeper always walked softly, but the
wind from their swinging feet rattled the doors and
windows of the cookhouse.</p>

<p>“There they go,” muttered Jonah Wiles. “Now
listen, Sam. They’ll be in the woods for an hour anyway.
Now’s yer chance to get in good with everybody
again. I want yeh to keep yer high place, ol’
feller. I’ve always loved yeh like a brother, an’ yer
trouble with the boys is grievin’ me to a shadder.”</p>

<p>“I shore appreciate your sympathy when all is givin’
me the cold shoulder,” said the cook disconsolately.
“But ’tain’t no use. Nobody seems willin’ to give
sourdough a real chance. Folks could use it fer ever’thing
if they wanted to, an’ now these fool loggers
even hate to eat it.”</p>

<p>Jonah Wiles replied with his usual shrewd arguments.
Every evening when he thought he had made
all the mischievous suggestions to the loggers that it
was wise to utter, he would come to the kitchen and,
pretending great sympathy and friendliness, he would
urge Sourdough Sam into enterprises that could only
end disastrously. He was now urging old Sam to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
dump sourdough into the timekeeper’s ink barrels during
his absence with Paul Bunyan. The cook had
long been sure that small quantities of sourdough
would treble the ink supply. But, disheartened and
discouraged, he had not ventured to broach the idea
to Johnny Inkslinger.</p>

<p>“Make it a surprise party,” suggested Jonah Wiles.
“Get busy, Sam. It’s yer chance to win a real name
for yerself.”</p>

<p>At last Sourdough Sam yielded to his tempter.</p>

<p>The flunkies had left the kitchen long before. The
stoves and cook tables were dark shapes in the twilight
shadows. Only the white sourdough tanks stood out
in the gloom. Jonah Wiles lifted the top from one of
them, and a hissing roar rose from its depths, where
the fermented dough worked and bubbled like quicklime.
Jonah Wiles beckoned to Sourdough Sam.
The cook’s eyes shone; he breathed heavily.</p>

<p>“It can’t help but work,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Now yer my ol’ friend—good ol’ Sourdough
Sam!” exclaimed Jonah Wiles heartily. “Now yer
talkin’. You’ll be king of the camp when Johnny
Inkslinger finds his ink barrels all full and wonders
how it happened. Be the hero yeh really are, Sam!”</p>

<p>“By hickory, I will!” declared the cook.</p>

<p>In a moment he was leaving the kitchen, a foaming
five gallon bucket of sourdough in each hand. Jonah
Wiles slipped through the shadows until he reached
a big tree. There he lingered and watched. He
knew certainly that this idea would bring evil on the
old cook. The sourdough would ruin the ink as it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
ruined everything else. But he had never dreamed of
such a grand disaster as befell. Johnny Inkslinger
had two dozen ink barrels. A hose line ran from each
one, and when he did his most furious figuring it was
necessary to attach all of them to his fountain pen in
order to get a sufficient flow of ink. The cook dumped
five gallons of sourdough into the first barrel and five
into the second; then he rushed back to the cookhouse
for more. At his sixth trip the first barrels he had
treated were boiling and steaming like miniature volcanoes.</p>

<p>“They’ll settle after bit,” said Sourdough Sam optimistically.</p>

<p>Vain hope. No sooner were the words uttered than
a barrel of ink exploded with a dull roar. The other
treated barrels followed with a blast that sounded like
a salvo of artillery fire. The camp was shaken. The
loggers rushed from the bunkhouses and saw a foaming
black torrent rolling out of the camp office. Sourdough
Sam was whirled forth on the flood. The
bravest of the loggers plunged into the boiling black
stream and dragged him to safety. He was unconscious,
and his left arm and right leg had been lost in
the explosion. He was gently carried into a bunkhouse.
The head flunky mounted his saddle horse
and galloped after Paul Bunyan.</p>

<p>Jonah Wiles moved inconspicuously among the excited
loggers. A hot exultation was in his heart; he
had never hoped for such a completely triumphant
revenge. New powers seemed to surge up in him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
too; he felt that he might bring about even greater
disasters than this one. But he cautiously repressed
these freshly burning hopes and carried the air of a
man made dumb by grief. Tobacco crumbs rubbed in
his eyes made the tears trickle down his lean cheeks.
As the loggers formed into groups and began to speak
of the sourdough explosion in doleful tones, they noted
the silent, mournful appearance of Jonah Wiles, and,
among such expressions as “I was allus afeard sompin
like it ud happen”—“Pore ol’ Sam, got to be a regular
sourdough fanatic”—“Powerful strange, ain’t it, the
way things work out in this life?”—were heard many
words of sympathy for Sourdough’s best friend. “Ol’
Jonah’s takin’ it perty hard.” “Yeh, you wouldn’t
think such an ol’ crab had that much feelin’ in him.”</p>

<p>Jonah Wiles heard them and chuckled evilly.
They were making his part easy for him. When Paul
Bunyan and his timekeeper thundered into camp he
was at the fore of the men who pressed around their
feet.</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger had the unfortunate cook brought
into the office, where he had room to work over him.
For half an hour surgical instruments, bandages and
bottles flashed through his hands as he doctored the
cook. Paul Bunyan watched him hopefully; Johnny
Inkslinger was not only the greatest figurer but the
greatest doctor of his time also.</p>

<p>At last he arose. “He’ll pull through, Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan thanked him and then fell into a profound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
contemplation of the feeding problem. Johnny
Inkslinger wiped the blots of ink from the walls and
the puddles from the floor.</p>

<p>“Only two barrels of ink left,” he groaned.
“How’ll I get through the winter, Mr. Bunyan?”</p>

<p>The great logger smiled grimly. “I only wish all
my problems were so simple,” he said. “Just leave
off dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s and you’ll save
ink for the necessary writing and figuring. When
the spring ink supply comes in you can go over your
books again.”</p>

<p>“Such a mind!” breathed the timekeeper worshipfully.</p>

<p>But Paul Bunyan felt that even his mind was unequal
to the perplexing problem before him. How
was he to feed his loggers now? Would they be content
with pea soup? Not for long, certainly. Even
sourdough hardly satisfied them now. And this dangerous
stuff, lively as gunpowder—who would dare to
mix, bake, boil, stew and roast it? No sourdough,
no work; and this meant another season in the upper
Red River country, for he had to be ready for the drive
before Redbottom Lake sank to its summer level.
Quick action was necessary. Paul Bunyan sent inquiries
among the kitchen help for a man who was
familiar with the methods of Sourdough Sam. The
head flunky reported that no one was so intimate with
the old cook as Jonah Wiles, a swamper.</p>

<p>The worst bunkhouse crank came into the presence
of Paul Bunyan with confidence that Sourdough Sam,
the soul of loyalty, had not mentioned him in connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
with the explosion. He presented a sorrowful,
tear-streaked countenance.</p>

<p>“Be consoled,” Paul Bunyan said gently. “Your
comrade was performing what he considered to be an
act of duty. He shall be remembered with great
honor. And I am offering you, his best friend, the
position he occupied.”</p>

<p>“I’m only a pore swamper, Mr. Bunyan,” said Jonah
Wiles, in nasal tones of humility “an’ I’d never be
able to make it in the high job of a cook.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan stroked his beard with a pine tree, as
was his habit in moments of earnest thought. And at
the same time Jonah Wiles was glowing with the fire
of dangerous inspiration; he had become firmly convinced
that he was a great originator of damaging
ideas. He remembered that Sourdough Sam had a
son; the old cook had often spoken of him with
parental pride and fondness. With the boy in camp
his revenge could go yet farther. Jonah Wiles
pounded on Paul Bunyan’s toe to attract his attention.
The great logger again bent down to him.</p>

<p>“Sourdough Sam has a son which he claims is a
greater cook than his dad already,” said the bunkhouse
crank. “I expect you could send an’ get him easy,
Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>“Where is he, lad?”</p>

<p>“He’s down in the Corn Pone country. That’s
where he’s learnin’ to be a better cook than Sam,
<span class="locked">an’——”</span></p>

<p>Jonah Wiles was bowled over by Paul Bunyan’s
jubilant roar. Johnny Inkslinger was ordered to set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
out for the Corn Pone country at once and to return
with the young cook, making all speed. The great
logger then called his men together and gave them a
rousing speech on the need for fast logging, promising
them that he would have the old cookhouse going
good again in a short time. The loggers cheered him
and went contentedly to bed, where all but Jonah
Wiles slept with good consciences. But to him the
bad conscience was the good one; he rejoiced in evil
thoughts. Not a pang of pity did he feel for Sourdough
Sam; he had no regrets; he dreamed only of
getting his clutches on the son of the man who had
ruined his bright pants.</p>

<p>While Johnny Inkslinger was speeding after the
new cook Paul Bunyan was struggling with the worst
difficulty he had ever encountered. The kitchen was
put in charge of the Galloping Kid, the head flunky,
for the time being. He was a grand horseman, a
mighty figure, as he rode his white horse among the
tables at meal time, directing the running flunkies,
but he knew little more about cooking than Paul Bunyan
himself.</p>

<p>His sourdough creations were all failures; the loggers
broke their teeth on them, and what they did
swallow was indigestible. All gayety vanished from
the bunkhouses; even the bards, with the noble exception
of the incomparable, unquenchable Shanty
Boy, got silent and morose. Each day less timber
was felled. In time the blue ox stood idle most of the
day, waiting for loads of logs to be hauled to the landings.
A successful conclusion of the logging seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
impossible, but Paul Bunyan would not admit it. A
late spring thaw, a great physical revival when the new
cook got into action—he stimulated the men with these
hopes and kept up some semblance of work in the
woods.</p>

<p>Jonah Wiles was now enjoying the happiest time of
his life. Everyone was in a state of wretchedness
that delighted him. He heard threats of revolt;
disastrous events were surely advancing their shadows
on the camp of Paul Bunyan; he gloated over the evil
he would wreck on the son of his enemy. But he kept
his feelings well hidden. His sly suggestions were
the source of many of the bitterest complaints the loggers
made against their life, but he never complained
now himself. His small blue eyes had a watery shine
of sympathy for everyone. He spent an hour each
night with Sourdough Sam, pretending to console him,
but actually enjoying his sufferings.</p>

<p>When the new cook arrived in camp Sourdough Sam
was able to sit up and introduce his son to Paul Bunyan—“Hot
Biscuit Slim, sir, who’s goin’ to be one
uh the greatest cooks uh history.”</p>

<p>The young man leaned nonchalantly against Paul
Bunyan’s toe and looked up calmly at the mighty
figure above him.</p>

<p>“I’ll shore be glad to work for you, Mr. Bunyan,”
he said. “But you’ll have to fix things accordin’ to
my ideas.”</p>

<p>“Son, the camp is yours,” rumbled Paul Bunyan.
“Half of my loggers are now too weak to lift an ax.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Hot Biscuit Slim shook his father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
good hand, smiled enigmatically when the old man
said, “I’m expectin’ you to succeed where I failed with
sourdough, boy,” and left to inspect the cookhouse.
Paul Bunyan and Johnny Inkslinger attended him.
When the inspection was finished he had many recommendations
to make. He <span class="locked">demanded——</span></p>

<p>A new cookhouse, ten times the size of the present
one.</p>

<p>Steam-power, force-feed batter mixers, and a hot
cake griddle large enough for a battalion of second
cooks to make a line around it.</p>

<p>A battery of great ovens for the baking of pies,
cakes, puddings and cookies.</p>

<p>Bins for potatoes and other vegetables.</p>

<p>Fruit and vinegar cellars.</p>

<p>Baking powder and sugar barrels.</p>

<p>Sauerkraut tanks and a frankfurter shed.</p>

<p>An air-tight onion room.</p>

<p>A store of ham, bacon and eggs for the loggers’
breakfasts....</p>

<p>“Hold on a moment!” exclaimed Paul Bunyan in
bewilderment. “Please tell me first: <em>what</em> are hot
cakes, pies, cookies, cakes, puddings, ham, bacon, eggs,
potatoes, baking powder, sauerkraut, frankfurters and
the rest of it? Can we get them from somewhere, or
must I invent them?”</p>

<p>Hot Biscuit Slim patiently explained them to the
great logger.</p>

<p>“Holy mackinaw!” said Paul Bunyan, greatly relieved,
“I never imagined such things could be. I’m
delighted that they’ve already been invented.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>Hot Biscuit Slim told him that they could all be
grown or manufactured on the great farm. Then he
went on to recommend that the flunkies be equipped
with roller skates, thus tripling their efficiency. He
made many other suggestions, and Paul Bunyan agreed
to all of them.</p>

<p>“Now to work,” said Hot Biscuit Slim. “I’ll have
a new sourdough dish for the loggers’ supper. Sourdough
is a contraption that’s seen it’s day, but I’ll
make the best of it while I got to use it. Send me
your blacksmith.”</p>

<p>A unique smell met the loggers when they crowded
eagerly into the cookhouse at suppertime, a delightful
odor that overpowered the weakest among them. And
when the flunkies trotted out, carrying huge platters
heaped high with brown, globular mysteries, each one
having a curious hole in the center, the famished loggers
all bounced about on their benches in uncontrollable
excitement, and well they might! For they
were being served with the first doughnuts! Doughnut
connoisseurs of to-day would have regarded them
as crude; they were made from sourdough, they were
hard as hickory and unsweetened. But Paul Bunyan’s
loggers shouted over them; they discovered to
their great leader the exuberance and expansion of
feeling, the exaltation of spirit, the strengthening of
moral qualities, which may develop from grand feeding.
As he listened to the extraordinary uproar in the
cookhouse and considered it he formed one of his great
reflections: Meals make the man.</p>

<p>Jonah Wiles was the one dismal figure among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
feasters. The doughnuts were bitter in his mouth because
they were so pleasing to him. He devoured
half a dozen of them and then forced himself to stop,
for he was beginning to feel good-humored. His gaze
turned shiftily towards the kitchen, where Hot Biscuit
Slim was frying doughnuts with astonishing rapidity.
The assistant cooks were rolling out the dough; Big
Ole, the blacksmith, bare-armed and streaming with
sweat, tossed the doughnuts on his anvil and punched
the holes in them with swift strokes. Jonah Wiles
glowered malignantly on the scene. With one meal
the son of his enemy had brought happiness to the
camp and achieved glory.</p>

<p>“He’ll learn Jonah Wiles has a few tricks yet,” the
worst bunkhouse crank muttered savagely.</p>

<p>After supper he waited for a lull in the bunkhouse
merriment. When it came he emitted a terrific groan.</p>

<p>“I’m afeard them new biscuits with the holes in
’em ain’t goin’ to set well on the stummick. I’m
<span class="locked">afeard——”</span></p>

<p>“Take yer bellyache outside!” yelled the loggers.</p>

<p>They shoved him through the door and began to
roar out their favorite song, “Jack Haggerty.”</p>

<p>“I’ve still got some tricks,” said Jonah Wiles.</p>

<p>He entered the kitchen and greeted Hot Biscuit
Slim with a twisted grin that was supposed to express
sympathy and understanding.</p>

<p>“I’m yer pap’s best friend,” he said unctuously,
“an’ I shore am glad to see yeh makin’ sech a fine beginnin’
with sourdough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>“Yeh?” said Hot Biscuit Slim.</p>

<p>“Yes siree! An’ I allus like to help folks get
along, too. I’ve jist thought uh somethin’ new
to try with sourdough. Yeh see, the loggers been
havin’ trouble gettin’ inner soles fer their boots. Now
if yer pap was doin’ it, why he’d jist slip into all the
bunkhouses to-night and put sourdough in every boot,
fer.... Here now, don’t yeh go to hit me! I’m a
ailin’ ol’ man, an’ crippled, too. What’s the matter
uh yeh, anyway?”</p>

<p>Hot Biscuit’s face was afire with rage.</p>

<p>“So you’re the pizen ol’ devil what got my ol’ man
into all that trouble, what nearly got him kilt, what
ruint his life!”</p>

<p>He grasped a cold doughnut, swung it far behind
him, then hurled it with terrific force at Jonah Wiles’
head. It struck him squarely between the eyes, and
he dropped without a groan.</p>

<p>“There!” panted Hot Biscuit Slim. “You moanin’
ol’ hound—you hissin’ ol’ reptile—you squawlin’ ol’
tomcat!...”</p>

<p>When Jonah Wiles recovered consciousness two
months later he discovered the camp in holiday attire.
When he learned the occasion of the celebration he was
bewildered. He saw the loggers forming in a great
crowd on the shore of Redbottom Lake. The water
line was low; the spring thaw had evidently come
early, for the lake was black with logs. The logging
had not been finished before the lake sank below its
outlet. Yet the camp was celebrating. Jonah Wiles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
wondered. Had the new biscuits made the loggers so
idiotically happy that no misfortune could quench
their spirits?</p>

<p>Jonah Wiles saw that a new cookhouse had been
built; the old one was now standing above a rollway
on the lake shore. From crevices in its swelling walls,
from the eaves and from the chimneys some thick
white stuff was oozing and bubbling. “Sourdough!”
exclaimed Jonah Wiles, yet more amazed.</p>

<p>At this moment Paul Bunyan lifted Sourdough Sam
aloft in his hand that all the loggers might see him.
The old cook waved a new crutch at his friends. He
was dressed in an amazing fine style; he was even
wearing a necktie. He seemed to be the hero of the
celebration.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan now made a speech. He told the
loggers of all the marvelous edibles that Hot Biscuit
Slim had revealed to him, and he explained in detail
his latest and greatest invention, the Big Feed. When
the loggers were done cheering Paul Bunyan paid a
tribute to Sourdough Sam; the old cook’s creation had
served a great purpose in the logging industry, he said.
Its day was done now, but there remained a last great
work for it to perform, a dramatic work that would
keep the memory of its creator alive forever. It was
fitting that Sourdough Sam should see this before retiring
to his old home. Now Paul Bunyan turned to
the big blue ox, who was hitched to blocks supporting
the old cookhouse.</p>

<p>“Yay, Babe!” he commanded.</p>

<p>The blue ox heaved, the old cookhouse tottered, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
it crashed down the rollway. A heaving mass of sourdough
rumbled from its cracking sides and surged like
a boiling tidal wave over the lake. The waters began
to hiss and foam; the logs were all hidden from sight;
the lake looked like a heavy white cloud had dropped
into its basin. The loggers all stared prayerfully;
hopeful, yet hardly daring to hope. Only Sourdough
Sam had confidence in the rising powers of his sourdough.
In Paul Bunyan’s hand, he shouted joyously
and waved his new crutch. The great logger himself
was not absolutely sure of success at first, but as the
tumult of the lake waters increased, he too showed joy
and carefully patted Sourdough Sam’s back with his
little finger. The leader-hero was pleased to share the
glory of this enterprise with such a noble and faithful
little man. Now the waters rose so rapidly that the
loggers rushed back in a panic. In half an hour the
sourdough had caused the lake to rise so high that the
season’s logs were all thundering down Red River
valley. It was a grand day for everyone; but it was
the grandest that Sourdough Sam had ever known.</p>

<p>Jonah Wiles was sickened by his enemy’s triumph.
He contemplated the magnificence of the new cookhouse,
and he realized that there was now small chance
of promoting misery among Paul Bunyan’s loggers.
The camp could be nothing but a hostile place for him
in the new dispensation. A dejected, baffled man, he
sneaked away in his white pants before the loggers returned,
and shambled over the hills, traveling towards
Kansas.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_90">THE BLACK DUCK DINNER</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Except</span> in the spring, when the log drives were being
made down the rivers, Sunday was a day of rest in
Paul Bunyan’s camp. It was a day of earnest
thought, and of cleanliness and pleasure also. For on
Sunday Paul Bunyan planned the next week’s work,
thought out his orations, imagined new inventions, and
dreamed of historical exploits for the future. And on
Sunday his loggers made their beds, cleaned their
clothes, and shaved their faces. The pleasures of this
day were the pleasures of the table, for Paul Bunyan,
after building his second cookhouse, and developing his
famous kitchen organization around Hot Biscuit Slim,
the chief cook, originated the custom of grand Sunday
dinners.</p>

<p>Every Sunday dinner was a feast; but some of them,
of course, were nobler and more enjoyable than others.
His roast pork and plum pudding dinners always delighted
the loggers when they were served on winter
Sundays; they shouted over the baked trout and cherry
pie Sunday dinners that he gave them in the spring; in
the summer a vegetable and strawberry shortcake Sunday
dinner made them happy every time; and in the
fall the Sunday dinners of fried chicken and peach
cobbler made them prance and roar with pleasure.
And the Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
roasted webfooted turkeys, cranberries and chocolate
cake—the loggers were always speechless when they
thought about them.</p>

<p>Every Sunday morning would see the loggers performing
the ceremonies of cleanliness as soon as their
after-breakfast pipes were smoked. First, the beds
were made; and this was a more trying job than you
would think, especially for the loggers who had poor
eyesight. These unfortunates would throw their blankets
into a pile, then shake them out one at a time, and
attempt to replace them in the bunks. Here difficulties
beset them, for Paul Bunyan’s blankets had small
square checks; and it took a sharp eye to detect which
was the long way of a blanket, and which was
the wide way. Even the most sharp-eyed loggers
would sometimes lose confidence in their vision when
replacing these perplexing blankets; and they would
remove them time and again before deciding that they
were spread correctly. As for the cross-eyed and near-sighted
men, it was sometimes pitiful to behold the
most troubled of them stretching out blankets in their
extended hands, turning them in slow revolutions,
doubtfully placing them on the bunks, and then
wearily lifting them again. These unfortunate men
never quitted their Sunday bed-making until they were
worn out; and all the following week they were sure
that they had the long way of their blankets on the
wide way of their bunks. They would swear to have
them right next time; but every Sunday their attempts
at bed-making would end in as unsatisfying a
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>Everyone in the West knows that sheepherders of
our time often worry themselves into insanity in their
lonely camps, trying to discover the wide way and the
long way of their quilts and blankets. Fortunately,
Paul Bunyan’s loggers were all strong-minded men,
and their blankets did no more than bedevil them.</p>

<p>After bed-making the loggers heated cans of water
over small fires built out in the timber, and they
washed their clothes. Shaving, boot-greasing, sole-calking,
hair-cutting, beard-trimming, button-sewing,
and rip-mending followed; and he was an expert in
these Sunday morning chores who had time to stretch
out on his smooth blankets for a smoke before the
dinner gong rang at twelve.</p>

<p>At the ringing of this gong the inexpressible pleasures
of Paul Bunyan’s Sundays began. First, the loggers
enjoyed the ecstasy of eating; and it was an
ecstasy they were fitted to enjoy gloriously. After
dinner the loggers would lie on their bunks and dream
drowsily all afternoon of a loggers’ paradise; and the
paradise they dreamed about was none other than Paul
Bunyan’s camp; but a camp whose life began each day
with a Sunday dinner, and whose days were all like
the warm drowsy hours of these Sunday afternoons.</p>

<p>But most of the loggers would be awake and hungry
again at suppertime, ready to enjoy the Sunday supper
of cold meat, potato salad, doughnuts, jelly rolls and
coffee. Then in the twilight, and for a long time
after the bunkhouse lamps were lit, they would smoke,
and talk contentedly of the delight they got from
Paul Bunyan’s cookhouse; and they would prophesy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
about the Sunday dinners of the future. There were
no bunkhouse pastimes on Sunday nights. After
some hours of low-voiced contented talk, the loggers
would change their underclothes and get into their
newly made beds, rested and inspired for Monday’s
labor.</p>

<p>The great cookhouse which so ennobled and cheered
Paul Bunyan’s loggers on their Sundays was the grandest
and best planned affair of its kind ever heard of.
The dining hall was so commodious and had so much
room between the tables that four-horse teams hauled
wagonloads of salt, pepper and sugar down the aisles
when the shakers and bowls were to be filled. Conveyor
belts carried clean dishes to the tables and returned
the dirty ones to the wash room. The long-legged
flunkies wore roller skates at mealtime, and the
fastest among them could sometimes traverse the dining
hall in forty-seven minutes.</p>

<p>But it was the kitchen, the powerhouse of this vast
establishment, which had the most interest. This
domain, ruled by the temperamental culinary genius,
Hot Biscuit Slim, was as large as ten Ford plants
and as noisy as the Battle of Gettysburg. The utensils
that hung on its walls, from the steam-drive potato
mashers and sleeve-valve, air-cooled egg beaters
to the big armorplate potato kettles, the bigger force-feed
batter mixers and the grandiose stew kettles, in
which carcasses of cattle floated about like chips in a
mill pond when beef dinners were being prepared—these
polished utensils glittered even when the ranges
were smoking their worst at hot cake time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Paul Bunyan had devised the monorail system for
this kitchen, and overhead cranes rattled about at all
hours, carrying loads of dishes from the Dishwashing
Department to the Serving Department, loads of vegetables
and meats from the Supply Department to the
Preparations Department, and loads of dressed food
from the Preparations Department to the Finishing
Department. The dishes were washed on a carriage
like the log carriages of modern sawmills. The head
dishwashers jerked levers that threw heaps of dirty
dishes from the conveyor belts to the carriage, then
the carriage was shot forward until the dishes struck
a sharp-edged stream of soapy water that had dropped
one hundred feet. The clean dishes were bucked off
on live rolls, and the head dishwasher shot the carriage
back for another load. Some of the clean dishes were
run through dry kilns, and others were piled for air-drying
by Swede dish-pilers, who wore leather aprons
and mittens and could pile sixty thousand dishes per
pair in twelve hours.</p>

<p>A list of the marvels of Paul Bunyan’s kitchen
would fill a book as large as a dictionary. Elevators
whirred between the kitchen and the vegetable bins,
and a wide subway held four tracks that led to the
fruit and vinegar cellars. A concrete chute carried
the coffee grounds, eggshells and other waste to the
kitchen yard, and from morning till night it roared
like a millrace. Billy Puget, boss over the scraper
gang, often had to work his mules and men fourteen
hours a day in order to keep the kitchen yard cleaned
of coffee grounds and eggshells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>Paul Bunyan’s loggers had little understanding of
the tremendous organization that was required for the
operation of such an establishment as the cookhouse.
They thanked old Paul for feeding them so well, and
they agreed that Hot Biscuit Slim was a powerful good
cook. Less fortunate loggers of to-day think of Paul
Bunyan’s camp life as a dream of bliss, and they are
sure that if they had been there they would have worshiped
Paul Bunyan. His own loggers, however,
took the cookhouse glories as a matter of course, and
they never realized what inventiveness, thought and
effort were needed to give them such Sunday dinners
and such Sunday afternoon dreams and content.</p>

<p>Nor did Paul Bunyan expect shouted praises and
thanks from his loggers. He gave so much to them
because he expected much from them. He worked his
men twelve hours a day, and, had they thought about
it, they would have been astounded by any idea of
working less. And they would have been perplexed
by any other scheme to ease their lot. If there were
not to be great exertions, they would have asked, why
their sturdy frames, their eager muscular force? If
they were not meant to face hazards, why was daring
in their hearts? A noble breed, those loggers of Paul
Bunyan’s, greatly worthy of their captain! He himself
told them in a speech he made at the finishing of
the Onion River Drive that they were “a good band
of bullies, a fine bunch of savages.” I should like to
quote this speech in its entirety, for it celebrated the
accomplishment of a historical logging enterprise, and
it was a master oration which showed the full range<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
and force of Paul Bunyan’s oratorical powers. But as
nine days and eight nights were required for its delivery,
it is obvious that no publication save the <i>Congressional
Record</i> could give all of it. It was at this
time that Paul Bunyan served his great black duck
dinner.</p>

<p>The speech ended on a Tuesday, and until the
following Saturday morning there were no sounds
save the snores of weary men and the scratching of the
sleepless Johnny Inkslinger’s fountain pen. By Saturday
noon he had a time check and a written copy
of the oration for every man in camp. After dinner
the Big Swede, using a fire hose, a ton of soap, and a
tank of hair tonic began to give the blue ox his spring
cleaning, and Johnny Inkslinger turned in for the three
hours of sleep which he required each week. Paul
Bunyan was arranging his personal belongings for the
move to a new job and musing on his recent accomplishment.
He had never driven logs down a rougher
or more treacherous stream than Onion River. And
the hills over which the timber had been skidded were
so rocky and steep that they tried even the strength of
the blue ox. Worst of all was the rank growth of wild
onions that had covered the ground. They baffled
all attempts to fell the trees at first, for they brought
blinding floods of tears to the loggers’ eyes and made
their efforts not only futile but dangerous. When the
Big Swede was standing on a hillside one day, dreaming
of the old country, he failed to observe a blinded
logger come staggering up the slope, and he did not
hear him mumble, “This looks like a good stick.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Not until the logger had chopped a notch in the leg
of his boot had the Big Swede realized his peril. Paul
Bunyan, baffled by such incidents, was about to abandon
the whole operation when the alert Johnny Inkslinger
heard of the failure of the Italian garlic crop.
He quickly made a contract with the Italian government,
which sent over shiploads of laborers to dig up
the wild onions and take them home as a substitute
for the national relish. When this had been accomplished
it was possible to log off the country.</p>

<p>There had been other difficulties to overcome, too,
and as Paul Bunyan spread out a tarpaulin and prepared
to roll up his boots and workclothes, he remembered
them and praised the saints that they were
ended. The next job offered the best promise of easy
and simple logging of any he had ever encountered.
For miles the land rose in gentle slopes from a wide
and smoothly flowing river; there was no brush or
noxious vegetation among the clean, straight trees;
and, best of all, the timber was of a species now extinct,
the Leaning Pine. The trees of this variety all
leaned in the same direction, and it was thus possible
to fell them accurately without the use of wedges.
Paul Bunyan was sure of a season’s record on this new
job. He thought of the fresh brilliancy it would
give his fame, and like a row of snowy peaks glimpsed
through the spaces of a forest, his teeth glittered
through his beard in a magnificent smile. But another
thought quickly sobered his countenance.
“Those good bullies of mine!” The words came in
a gusty murmur. He dropped the tarpaulin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
strode over to the cookhouse. Hot Biscuit Slim, the
kitchen chief, came forth to meet him. There was a
knowing look in the cook’s eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s to be a great Sunday dinner to-morrer?” he
asked, before Paul Bunyan could speak.</p>

<p>“The greatest Sunday dinner ever heard of,” said
Paul Bunyan. “I want this to be remembered as the
noblest meal ever served in a logging camp. My loggers
shall feast like the victorious soldiers of old time.
It is a natural privilege of heroes to revel after conquest.
Remember, as you prepare this feast, that you
may also be making immortal glory for yourself.”</p>

<p>“You jest leave it to me, Mr. Bunyan!” answered
Slim. “If the baker’ll do his part with the cream
puffs, cakes and pies, I promise you I’ll make ’em a
meal to remember. First, oyscher stew, an’ then for
vegytables, cream’ cabbage, of course, mash’ potatoes
an’ potato cakes, lettuce an’ <span class="locked">onions——”</span></p>

<p>“No onions!” thundered Paul Bunyan. There was
a terrific crash in the kitchen as hundreds of skillets
and kettles were shaken to the floor.</p>

<p>“Uh—I forgot,” stammered Hot Biscuit Slim.
“Well, anyway, they’ll be oyscher soup, vegytables,
sauces, puddin’s, hot biscuits, an’ meat in dumplin’
stew an’ mulligan stew, an’ they’ll be drippin’ roasts,
all tender an’ rich-seasoned—oh, the meat that I’ll
give ’em! the meat—” he paused sharply, shivered as
though from a physical shock, and misery glistened in
his <span class="locked">eyes—“only—uh—only——”</span></p>

<p>“Only you have no meat,” said Paul Bunyan gently.</p>

<p>“I’m admittin’ it,” said Slim wretchedly. “Honest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Mr. Bunyan, no matter how I try I jest <em>can’t</em> remember
to order meat, ’specially for Sunday dinner.
I can remember vegytables, fruits an’ greens easy as
pie, but, by doggy, I always forget meat. I ain’t pertendin’
a cook’s worth keepin’ who can’t remember
meat, no matter how good he is at a fixin’ it. I
wouldn’t blame you if you fired me right off, Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>Hot Biscuit Slim leaned against the toe of the hero’s
boot and wept.</p>

<p>“That means I must rustle deer and bear,” said
Paul Bunyan patiently. “Well, bear meat and venison
will make a royal feast when they have passed
through your kettles and ovens. Light the fires, go
ahead with your plans; you may yet make history to-morrow!”</p>

<p>He turned away, and Hot Biscuit Slim watched him
worshipfully until he was a dim figure on distant hills.</p>

<p>“The best friend me an’ my pap ever had,” he said.
“I’d do anything for a boss like that. I’ll learn to
remember meat, by doggy, I will!”</p>

<p>Rumors of the marvelous dinner that was being
planned reached the bunkhouses, and the loggers indulged
in greedy imagining of the promised delights.
The day went slowly; the sun seemed to labor down
the western sky. Before it sank soft clouds obscured
its light, bringing showers and early shadows.</p>

<p>At the approach of darkness Paul Bunyan began his
return march to the camp. He was vastly disappointed
by the meager results of his hunt. Although
he had gone as far as the Turtle River country, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
snared but two deer and three small bears. These
only filled a corner of one pocket of his mackinaw,
and they would provide but a mere shred of meat
apiece for his men. Paul Bunyan did not feel that
he had done his best; he was not one to rest on feeble
consolations. As he journeyed on he was devising
other means to carry out his plans for a memorable and
stupendous feast. And ere he was within an hour of
the camp the Big Swede was unconsciously outlining
the solution of the problem for him.</p>

<p>The Big Swede went to the stable some time after
supper to see that Babe was at ease for the night.
The clouds were thinning now, and when he opened
the stable door soft light poured in on the blue ox,
making lustrous spots and streaks on his sleek sides.
He turned his head, his bulging blue eyes shining with
gentleness and good-will, and his tongue covered the
foreman’s face in a luscious caress.</p>

<p>“Har noo,” remonstrated the Big Swede.</p>

<p>As he solemnly wiped his drenched face he sniffed
the fragrance of Babe’s breath and stared with a feeling
of envy at the clean, glowing hair. When he had
finished his inspection and left the stable, it was evident
that he was wrestling with some laborious problem.
His whole face was tense with a terrific frown;
his memory groped among the shadows of some distant
happening; he scratched his sides vigorously and
breathed deeply of the air, sweet with the odors of
washed earth. The purity of the spring weather, the
fresh cleanliness it gave the world, and the aroma and
sleekness of the blue ox, had brought the Big Swede<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
to face his own sore need of a washing. He dreaded
it as an ordeal, an exceptional and hazardous undertaking,
and for that reason he wished that he might
accomplish it immediately. He wandered aimlessly
on, tormented by an unaccustomed conflict of the soul
and the flesh, and at last he came to the edge of a cliff.
He stared in surprise at the appearance of a lake below.
He could not remember so large a body of
water near the camp. But the Big Swede had no room
for more than one emotion at a time, and a violent resolve
now smothered his surprise.</p>

<p>“Yah, aye do him noo,” he muttered.</p>

<p>He disrobed swiftly and ran to a rock that jutted
from the cliff. Swinging his fists he leaped twice
into the air; the second time he flung himself outward
in a magnificent dive, his body made a great curve,
and then, head first, he plunged downward. But
there was no tumultuous surge and splash of waters
as a climax of this splendid dive. Instead, the Big
Swede’s head struck white canvas with a dull, rending
impact. For he had mistaken Paul Bunyan’s tarpaulin
for a lake! The force of his plunge drove him
through the canvas and half-buried him in the soft
earth underneath. His arms were imprisoned, but
his legs waved wildly, and his muffled bellows shook
the earth. A prowling logger saw what seemed to
be shining marble columns dancing in the moonlight
and felt the ground trembling under his feet.</p>

<p>“It can’t be,” he thought bravely.</p>

<p>Just then the Big Swede made another heroic effort
to yell for help, and the logger was shaken from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
feet. He jumped up and ran to Johnny Inkslinger
with an alarming tale of dancing ghosts that shook the
earth. The timekeeper, after sharpening twenty-seven
lead pencils to use in case it was necessary to
make a report on the spot, started with his medicine
case for the place where the logger had directed him.
When nearly there he remembered that he had failed
to bring his ten gallon carboy of alcohol, which, next
to Epsom salts, he considered the most important medicine
in his chest. He ran back for it, and by the time
he finally reached the Big Swede, that unfortunate’s
bellows had diminished to groans, and his legs waved
with less and less gusto. After thoroughly examining
and measuring the legs, Johnny deemed the proof
positive that they belonged to the Big Swede. Then
he got busy with paper and pencil and figured for half
an hour. “According to the strictest mathematical
calculations,” he announced, “the Big Swede cannot
continue to exist in his present interred, or, to be exact,
half-interred condition; consequently he must be extricated.
I have considered all known means by which
this may be accomplished, I have figured, proved, and
compared results, and I have arrived at a scientific conclusion.
I direct that the blue ox and a cable be
brought here at once.”</p>

<p>When the loggers had obeyed this command,
Johnny made a half-hitch with the cable around the
Big Swede’s legs, which were waving very feebly now,
and in two seconds, amid a monstrous upheaval of
dirt and a further rending of the canvas, the Big Swede
was dragged out. For a few moments he spat mud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
like a river dredge; then the timekeeper proffered him
the ten gallon carboy of alcohol. It was drained at a
gulp, and then, with aid from Johnny Inkslinger, he
was able to stagger to the camp office. When Paul
Bunyan reached the camp, the Big Swede was lying
on his bunk, bundled in bandages from head to foot.
Johnny Inkslinger was still busily attending him;
bottles of medicine, boxes of pills, a keg of Epsom
salts, rolls of bandages, and surgical implements were
heaped about the room. The timekeeper gave a detailed
account of what had happened, and then Paul
Bunyan questioned the victim, who answered briefly,
“Aye yoomped, an’ aye yoomped, an’—<em>yeeminy</em>!”</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger gave his chief a voluminous report
of the Big Swede’s fractures, sprains and contusions.</p>

<p>“He is also suffering from melancholia because he
is still unwashed,” said Johnny. “But I think I’ll
restore him. I’ve dosed him with all my medicines
and smeared him with all my salves. I’d have manipulated
his spine, but, confound him, he strained his
back, and he threatens violence when I touch it. But
I have many formulae and systems. He shall live.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Paul Bunyan. “A man is the hardest
thing to kill there is.”</p>

<p>Knowing that the Big Swede’s wounds were nothing
in comparison with the ones which he had received in
the Dakota battle, Paul Bunyan worried no more
about his foreman. He stepped from the camp office,
plucked up a young pine tree and brushed his beard,
thinking again of his unrealized plan. He remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
the wordless dejection of Hot Biscuit Slim on
receiving the scanty supply of deer and bear meat.
He determined that the Sunday dinner should yet be
as he had planned it; otherwise it would be a bad
augury for great achievements in his new enterprise.
He thrust the tree into his shirt pocket and walked
slowly towards his outdoor headquarters, pondering
various schemes that came to mind.</p>

<p>When he reached the white sheet of water he was
astonished by its deceptive appearance. It had a
silvery glitter in the moonlight, for its surface still
held the moisture of the showers. Small wonder,
thought Paul Bunyan, that the Big Swede had dived
into it; never was a lake more temptingly beautiful or
seemingly more deep. He was gazing at the torn canvas
and the huge cavity made in the ground by the
Big Swede, when he heard a great chorus of shrill and
doleful voices in the sky. He looked up and saw an
enormous host of black ducks in swerving flight.
They had lost their way in the low-hanging clouds at
dusk, and now they were seeking a resting place.</p>

<p>Here, thought Paul Bunyan, is a noble offering of
chance. Was a black duck more acute than the Big
Swede, that the bright, moist canvas would not deceive
him also? And once deceived, would not the ensuing
dive be fatal? Wasn’t a black duck’s neck of more
delicate structure than the Big Swede’s, and wouldn’t
it surely break when it struck the tarpaulin? This
variety of black duck grew as big as a buzzard, and
here they were so numerous that clouds of them darkened
the moon. Now to deceive them. Paul Bunyan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
could mimic the voices of all the birds of the air
and all the beasts of the fields and woods, save only
that of the blue ox, who always replied with a jocular
wink when his master attempted to simulate his mellow
moo. In his moments of humor Paul Bunyan declared
that he could mimic fish, and one Sunday when
he imitated a mother whale bawling for her calf the
loggers roared with merriment for seventeen hours,
and were only sobered then by exhaustion. His voice
had such power that he could not counterfeit the cry
of a single small creature, but only the united cries of
flocks and droves. So he now mimicked perfectly the
chorus that rang mournfully in the sky, and at the
same time he grasped the edge of the tarpaulin and
fluttered it gently.</p>

<p>The effect was marvelous. Now indeed was the
canvas a perfect imitation of water. Had you been
standing by the sole of Paul Bunyan’s boot and seen
the gentle flutter you would have been sure that you
were watching a breeze make pleasant ripples on the
surface of a lake. Ere long the black ducks were
enchanted by the sight and sound, and Paul Bunyan
heard a violent rush of air above him as of a hurricane
sweeping a forest. A vast dark cloud seemed to
plunge out of the sky. Another instant and the canvas
was black with feathered forms. Paul Bunyan
grasped the four corners of the tarpaulin, swung the
bundle over his shoulder and strode home to the cookhouse.
Hot Biscuit Slim was called forth, and when
he saw the mountainous pile of black ducks that filled
the kitchen yard he became hysterical with delight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
He called out the assistant cooks, the flunkies and dishwashers,
and, led by Cream Puff Fatty, the baker, the
white-clad underlings streamed for eleven minutes
from the kitchen door. The chief cook then made
them a short but inspiring speech and fired them with
his own fierce purpose to make culinary history.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan listened for a moment, and then
sought repose, with peace in his benevolent heart.</p>

<p>All night fires roared in the ranges as preparations
went on for the great dinner. The elevators brought
a load of vegetables every minute from the deep bins,
potatoes were pared and washed, kettles and roasting
pans were made ready, and sauces and dressings were
devised. The black ducks were scalded, plucked and
cleaned by the Preparations Department, and by morning
the cranemen were bringing them by the hundreds
to the Finishing Department, where the kettles and
pans were waiting for them.</p>

<p>Most of the loggers stayed in their bunks this morning,
and those who did come to breakfast ate sparingly,
saving their appetites. Time passed quietly in the
camp. The loggers washed and mended their clothes
and greased their boots, but they did not worry themselves
with bed-making. The other Sunday morning
chores finished, they stretched out on their unmade
bunks and smoked. They were silent and preoccupied,
but now and again a breeze blowing from the direction
of the cookhouse would cause them to sigh.
What enchantment was in the air, so redolent with the
aroma of roasting duck and stewing cabbages, so
sharply sweet with the fragrance of hot ginger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
cinnamon from the bakery where Cream Puff Fatty
fashioned his creations! A logger who was shaving
would take a deep breath of this incense, and the blood
would trickle unnoticed from a slash in his cheek; another,
in his bunk would let his pipe slip from his hand
and enjoy ardent inhalations, blissfully unaware of his
burning shirt; yet another, engaged in greasing his
boots, would halt his task and sit in motionless beatitude,
his head thrown back, his eyes closed, quite
unconscious of the grease that poured from a tilted can
into a prized boot.</p>

<p>At half past eleven the hungriest of the loggers began
to mass before the cookhouse door, and as the
minutes passed the throng swiftly increased. At five
minutes to noon all the bunkhouses were empty and the
furthest fringe of the crowd was far up Onion River
valley. The ground shook under a restless trampling,
and the faces of the loggers were glowing and eager
as they hearkened to the clatter and rumble inside the
cookhouse, as four-horse teams hauled in loads of salt,
pepper and sugar for the shakers and bowls. Then
the loggers began to stamp and shout as they heard
the flunkies, led by the Galloping Kid on his white
horse, rushing the platters and bowls of food to the
tables. Tantalizing smells wafted forth from the
steaming dishes. The loggers grew more restless and
eager; they surged to and fro in a tidal movement;
jests and glad oaths made a joyous clamor over the
throng. This was softened into a universal sigh as
the doors swung open and Hot Biscuit Slim, in spotless
cap and apron, appeared wearing the impressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
mien of a conquering general. He lifted an iron bar
with a majestic gesture, paused for dramatic effect
amid a breathless hush, and then struck a resounding
note from the steel triangle that hung from the wall.
At the sound a heaving torrent of men began to pour
through the doors in a rush that was like the roaring
plunge of water when the gate of a dam is lifted.
The chief cook continued to pound out clanging
rhythms until the last impatient logger was inside.</p>

<p>Then Hot Biscuit Slim reëntered the cookhouse.
He was reminded of a forested plain veiled in thin fog
as he surveyed the assemblage of darkly clad figures,
wreathed with white and fragrant blooms of steam.
His impression was made the more vivid when the
loggers plunged their spoons into the deep bowls of
oyster soup, for the ensuing sounds seemed like the
soughing of wind in the woods. The chief cook
marched to the kitchen with dignity and pride, glancing
to right and left at the tables that held his masterwork.
He asked for no praise or acclaim; the ecstasy
that now transfigured the plainest face was a sufficient
light of glory for him.</p>

<p>The soup bowls pushed aside, the loggers began to
fill their plates, which were of such circumference that
even a long-armed man could hardly reach across one.
The black ducks, of course, received first attention.
And great as the plates were, by the time one was
heaped with a brown fried drumstick, a ladle of duck
dumplings, several large fragments of duck fricassee,
a slab of duck baked gumbo style, a rich portion of
stewed duck, and a mound of crisp brown dressing, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
immersed in golden duck gravy, a formidable space was
covered. Yet there was room for tender leaves of
odorous cabbage beaded and streaked with creamy
sauce; for mashed potatoes which seemed like fluffs of
snow beside the darkness of duck and gravy; for brittle
and savory potato cakes, marvelously right as to
texture and thickness; for stewed tomatoes of a sultry
ruddiness, pungent and ticklish with mysterious spices;
for a hot cob of corn as long as a man’s forearm,
golden with sirupy kernels as big as buns; for fat and
juicy baked beans, plump peas, sunny applesauce and
buttered lettuce, not to mention various condiments.
Squares of cornbread and hot biscuits were buttered
and leaned against the plate; a pot-bellied coffee-pot
was tilted over a gaping cup, into which it gushed an
aromatic beverage of drowsy charm; a kingly pleasure
was prepared. More than one logger swooned
with delight this day when his plate was filled and,
red-faced, hot-eyed, wet-lipped, he bent over it for the
first mouthful with the joy of a lover claiming a first
embrace.</p>

<p>In the kitchen the chief cook, the baker and their
helpers watched and listened. At first the volume of
sounds that filled the vast room was like the roar and
crash of an avalanche, as dishes were rattled and
banged about. Then the duck bones crackled like
the limbs of falling trees. At last came a steady
sound of eating, a sound of seventy threshing machines
devouring bundles of wheat. It persisted far beyond
the usual length of time, and Hot Biscuit Slim brought
out his field glasses and surveyed the tables. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
loggers were still bent tensely over their plates, and
their elbows rose and fell with an energetic movement
as they scooped up the food with undiminished vigor.</p>

<p>“Still eatin’ duck,” marveled Hot Biscuit Slim.</p>

<p>“They won’t be more’n able to <em>smell</em> my cream
puffs,” said the baker enviously.</p>

<p>The loggers ate on. They had now spent twice
their usual length of time at the table. Each plate
was in a dark shadow from tall rows of slick black
duck bones and heaps of corn cobs. <span class="locked">But——</span></p>

<p>“Still eatin’ duck,” reported Hot Biscuit Slim.</p>

<p>That no one might see his grief Cream Puff Fatty
moved to a dark corner. He was now certain that
none of the loggers could have room for his pastries.
They ate on. They had now spent three times their
usual length of time at the table. The baker was
sweating and weeping; he was soaked with despair.
Then, suddenly:</p>

<p>“They’re eatin’ cream puffs!” cried Hot Biscuit
Slim.</p>

<p>Cream Puff Fatty could not believe it, but a thrill
of hope urged him to see for himself. True enough,
the loggers were tackling the pastries at last. On
each plate cream puffs the size of squashes lay in
golden mounds. As the spoons struck them their
creamy contents oozed forth from breaks and crevices.
Stimulated by their rich flavor, the loggers ate on with
renewed gusto. They had now stayed four times as
long as usual at the table. Other enchantments still
kept them in their seats: lemon pies with airy
frostings, yellow pumpkin pies strewn with brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
spice specks, cherry pies with cracks in their flaky
crusts through which the red fruit winked, custard
pies with russet freckles on their golden faces, fat apple
pies all odorous with cinnamon, cool, snowy cream
pies, peach cobblers, chocolate puddings, glittering
cakes of many colors, slabs of gingerbread, sugar-powdered
jelly rolls, doughnuts as large around as
saucers and as thick through as cups, and so soft and
toothsome that a morsel from one melted on the tongue
like cream. So endearing were the flavors of these
pastries that the loggers consumed them all.</p>

<p>Cream Puff Fatty and Hot Biscuit Slim solemnly
shook hands. There was glory enough for both of
them.</p>

<p>At last there were no sounds at the tables save those
of heavy breathing. The loggers arose in a body and
moved sluggishly and wordlessly from the cookhouse.
They labored over the ground towards the bunkhouses
as wearily as though they had just finished a day of
deadening toil. Soon Onion River valley resounded
with their snores and groans....</p>

<p>At supper time, when Hot Biscuit Slim rang the
gong, Cream Puff Fatty stood by his side. This was
to be the supreme test of their achievement. For five
minutes the chief cook beat the triangle, and then a
solitary logger appeared in the door of a bunkhouse.
He stared at them dully for a moment and then
staggered back into the darkness. This was indeed a
triumph! Great as other feasts in the cookhouse had
been, never before had <em>all</em> the loggers been unable to
appear for supper. This was a historic day. Cream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Puff Fatty and Hot Biscuit Slim embraced and
mingled rapturous tears. It was their high moment.
They would not have traded it for all the glory that
was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome....
They had intimations of immortality....</p>

<p>For five weeks the loggers lay in a delicious torpor,
and then Johnny Inkslinger brought them from their
bunks with doses of alcohol and Epsom salts. By
this time the Big Swede had recovered from his injuries,
and Paul Bunyan waited no longer to move his
camp. The buildings, which rested on skids, were
chained and cabled together, and the blue ox hauled
them over the hills to the new job.</p>

<p>Nothing marred the beauty of that summer; stirring
breezes blew all the days over the loggers as they
felled the Leaning Pine trees in perfect lines on the
grassy slopes. The blue ox waxed fat with the ease
of his labor. Weeks passed without the Big Swede
having a serious accident. Dust gathered on Johnny
Inkslinger’s medicine case. Hot Biscuit Slim never
once failed to remember meat. And a record number
of logs were piled above the rollways. Paul Bunyan
planned a great drive with prideful confidence that it
would be the glorious climax of a historic season.
But here fortune deserted him, for, after driving the
logs for nine days, and seeing an exact repetition of
scenery three times, he had Johnny Inkslinger survey
the placid river. The river was round; it flowed in
a perfect circle; and Paul Bunyan had driven the logs
three times over the same course!</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, he thereupon determined to saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
the logs and transport the lumber overland, and he
erected his famed sawmill, which was nineteen stories
high, with each bandsaw and each circular saw running
through all the floors. A description of the original
machines and devices used in this mill would fill the
pages of a mail order catalogue. It is needless to say
that it operated perfectly. The only great difficulty
Paul Bunyan had to overcome originated from the
smokestacks. He was compelled to equip them with
hinges and drawbridge machinery so that they could
be lowered to let the clouds go by.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_114">THE OLD HOME CAMP</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> old home camp of Paul Bunyan, was in the
Smiling River country; it lay in a great plain, between
this sunny stream and the flowered banks of Honey
Creek, which lazed on past the camp ere it joined the
river. When the sun got low in the West, the shadow
of old Rock Candy Mountain crept over the camp.
On hot summer days the frost-hued mountain was a
freshening sight; at night it looked like a huge dish of
white ice cream. Raspberry trees covered its lower
slopes, and in the Junetime they were heavy with
berries as big as apples. The lemonade springs bubbled
from among these trees, and their waters rippled
through blossoming strawberry bushes as they coursed
towards the river. In the twilights of the fruitful
season the songs of the jaybirds that nested in the raspberry
trees sank to a soft and sentimental chorus; and
their slumbrous melodies, mingled with the cheery
“jemine-e-es” of the jeminy crickets that lived among
the strawberry bushes, made a beauty of sound harmonious
with the spirit of eventide.</p>

<figure id="ip_114" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="947" height="1375" alt="Fat man bending over"></figure>

<p>The old home camp had been built in the midst of a
grove of maples. It had been deserted for seven years,
and only a few moss-covered bunkhouses yet remained.
Some bare sections of land, deeply corrugated, showed
where the great cookhouse had stood; and trails that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>had been packed by the trampling of thousands of
calked boots were still marked through lush growths
of grass.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan’s farm was the source of his supplies;
it was ruled by John Shears and worked by the scissor-bills.
It covered the rich bottom lands below Honey
Creek, and it extended for miles over the bordering
hills. Huge red clover blooms tossed and nodded on
crowns and slopes when the warm June breezes
blew. When the two happy but sensitive bees, Bum
and Bill, had got enough honey from them to fill the
thirty-five hundred barrels which were required for the
loggers’ hot cakes each winter, John Shears and the
scissor-bills mowed the hay and baled it. Then the
milk cows were pastured on the stubble until wintertime.
They did not have such grandiose names as are
given to cows nowadays—no one in Paul Bunyan’s
time would have thought of naming a kind, honest
heifer Wondrous Lena Victress or Dairylike Daffodil
Sweetbread;—they were simply called Suke, Boss,
Baldy and S’manthy, but they were queenly milkers.
Boss was the great butter cow; John Shears had only
to put salt in her milk, stir it a bit, let it stand for a
while, and he would have tubfuls of the finest
butter in the land. Suke’s milk made wonderful
bubbly hot cakes. Baldy’s milk never soured, and
it was especially good in cream gravy. S’manthy’s
milk was pretty poor stuff, but she had a vast hankering
for balsam boughs, and in the winter she would
eat them until her milk became the most potent of
cough medicines. It saved Paul Bunyan’s loggers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
from many an attack of pneumonia. The grand flocks
of poultry, which were ruled by Pat and Mike, the
powerful and bellicose webfooted turkey gobblers,
performed marvels of egg-laying and hatching. The
snow hens, for example, would lay only in the wintertime;
they made their nests in the snow and laid none
but hard-boiled eggs. There were great vegetable
gardens in the bottom lands; there the parsnips and
carrots grew to such a depth that the scissor-bills had
to use stump-pullers to get them out of the ground.
It took two men an hour and a half to sever the
average cabbage from its stalk. The potatoes grew to
such a size that Paul Bunyan invented the steam
shovel for John Shears to use in digging them out.
In the chewing tobacco patch the tobacco grew on the
plants in plugs, shreds and twists, and it was highly
flavored by the natural licorice in the soil.</p>

<p>It would take pages to describe all of the marvels
and splendors of Paul Bunyan’s farm.</p>

<p>For five years now Paul Bunyan had not visited his
farm or the old home camp. He himself knew
nothing of farming; first and last he was a logger, so
he had left his farm completely in the control of John
Shears when the great move was made from the old
home camp. He trusted without doubts his boss
farmer, who was a powerfully religious man. Only
his violent piety had made him a failure as a woods
boss. The loggers could not <em>bear</em> to be preached to,
and John Shears had insisted on preaching to them
through every meal. But he managed the scissor-bills
ably; they were men who had failed to make good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
as loggers and who had the calm and meek spirit of
born farm hands. John Shears had easily taught them
to venerate him as a prophet, and they willingly
worked sixteen hours a day for him, though the loggers
had never worked more than twelve.</p>

<p>After Paul Bunyan’s departure, John Shears had
faithfully improved the farm, and at last it became
so productive that even the endless freight teams of
Shagline Bill could not move all its hay and produce
to the far-away logging enterprises. Then only the
simple routine of farm work remained to be done, and
this hardly fetched fourteen hours of labor a day from
the scissor-bills, even in the harvesting season. John
Shears, always a terror for work, got dissatisfied. He
began to dream of strange, tempting projects of irrigation
and land-clearing. He let himself imagine Paul
Bunyan’s logging crews digging ditches, grubbing out
stumps, and leveling hills into grand hay and grain
fields. Then his dream became an active idea. If
logging could somehow be prohibited, abolished,
totally exterminated—what then? The loggers would
all have to turn farm hands, for farming would be the
only remaining industry. And then he, John Shears,
the one and only master farmer, would become supreme
over all of them; he would have Paul Bunyan’s place,
and the great logger would have to take a lesser
rôle! Soon, waking or sleeping, the idea was always
in his mind. It was the root of many plans, and at
last it threw out a monstrous growth. John Shears
planned nothing else than to do away with Babe, the
blue ox, who skidded all of Paul Bunyan’s logs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
the river landings, who was the mainspring, the central
motive force, of all his logging operations. Logging
without Babe could no more be imagined than rain
without clouds. This plan was the source of the
prodigious poison parsnip plot.</p>

<p>Parsnips were Babe’s favorite delicacy, and John
Shears was supposed to ship the parsnip crop to the
logging camp each fall. But in the year in which the
monstrous plot was hatched he did not dig the parsnips
at all. He allowed them to go to seed instead, and
now the parsnip patch was rank with a poisonous
second growth. John Shears intended to dig them in
another month and ship them to the camp. The blue
ox would eat them and die, and then he, the boss
farmer, should attain the power and triumph of his
dreams.</p>

<p>Little Meery, the farm slavey, alone was kept in
ignorance of John Shears’ schemes, not because he was
feared or distrusted, but because he seemed so lowly,
abject and unimportant. He had scarcely more
consequence in the farm life than one of the snow
hens. He slept on a hard bunk under the kitchen sink.
He was not allowed to associate with the scissor-bills.
The only attention he ever received from them was
when they made him the object of blows and ridicule.
One time he had been Thomas O’Meery, the Irish
Orphan, an aspiring young logger. The rich food
served in Paul Bunyan’s cookhouse had been his
undoing. He became obese, rotund, unable to swing
an ax. He got such heft and circumference that he
was a nuisance. Whenever he fell down he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
have to roll around until he could find a logger who
would lift him to his feet. He was a danger also.
One time he rolled down a hill and bounced head-on
into a column of marching loggers. He flattened
every one, and Johnny Inkslinger, the timekeeper and
camp doctor, was busy all night setting their broken
ribs. After this mishap, Paul Bunyan turned him
over to John Shears. The boss farmer gave him the
meanest job on the farm; he put him to washing the
dishes and slopping the pigs. Little Meery finally
became resigned to his grievous affliction and lowly
lot, and a spirit of sublime meekness sustained him
even when he was most cruelly treated.</p>

<p>This corpulent child of misfortune had a rare and
charming soul. He alone, of all the toilers on the
great farm, felt the pastoral loveliness of his surroundings.
His day of toil done, he would part
his hair, gather a bunch of clover blooms, take
Porkums, his little lame pet pig under his arm,
waddle over the footbridge that crossed Honey
Creek, and in the grounds of the old home camp enjoy
his one small pleasure in life. Sitting on an old maple
log, he would pretend that he was a lean, muscular
head faller in Paul Bunyan’s camp and one of the
great logger’s favorites. He would see himself as a
bunkhouse hero, walking in the shadows of the blue ox,
living a grand, free life. What delight Little Meery
had from such imaginings! What pity that they had
to fade! Little Meery always tried to be bravely
cheerful when the dream was done. He would force
back his tears, return the comforting squeals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Porkums with a trembling smile, then move gently
among the jaybirds, which always gathered trustingly
around his feet, and return to his cruel slavey’s life
with only thoughts of kindness and charity for John
Shears and the scissor-bills. If Paul Bunyan could
only have truly known that heart of gold!</p>

<p>One evening in the old home camp Little Meery’s
imaginings became more active than usual. He
pretended that he was winning a felling championship,
while Paul Bunyan applauded him.... He made
great chips fly like buckshot, the loggers were a
cheering host, he swung the ax violently at every
stroke.... Too late he felt himself slipping from
the maple log, and he rolled helplessly to the ground.
As usual, he could not get back on his feet. He
rolled to the footbridge, but he could not pass between
the railings. He lay there until dawn, and no help
came. The morning passed, and still he lay helpless.
He was not found until John Shears came to the
farmhouse for dinner and discovered the breakfast
dishes unwashed.</p>

<p>“Did it on puppus, I bet!” roared the boss farmer.
“I’d let ye lay there an’ rot ef ’twarn’t fer the dishes.
I got a mind to whale ye anyhow, hi gravy!”</p>

<p>“Please, oh, please don’t beat me, Mr. Shears,”
pleaded Little Meery. “I tried to roll home, honest I
did.”</p>

<p>The boss farmer brought an ellum club into view.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>by</em> gosh! Mr. <span class="locked">Shears——”</span></p>

<p>“Swearin’, hey?”</p>

<p>“I meant to say ‘my’—honest!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t nuther. Ye used a ‘by’ word, an’ ye know
plagued well ye meant to be profane!”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh’” screamed poor Little Meery, as the
blows poured upon him. John Shears beat him until
sundown, taking five minutes out of each hour for
rest.... He raised the ellum club for a last terrific
blow, and Little Meery bravely tried to stifle his sobs,
as he waited to receive it. The cruel blow was never
delivered. Two words stopped it.</p>

<p>“Here ... John!”</p>

<p>The words seemed to be calmly spoken, yet the
tones that made them filled the vast plain of the home
camp and reverberated in thunderous echoes among all
the hills. The trees shook, the surface of Smiling
River broke into violent waves, the slopes of old Rock
Candy were disturbed by the smoke and roar of an
avalanche. John Shears quietly dropped his ellum
club; Little Meery opened his eyes and saw near him
a boot with a toe cap made of an elephant hide.
Then he looked up and beheld the kindly bearded
countenance of the good and mighty Paul Bunyan
looming above him. Then John Shears hastily helped
him to his feet and he limped between the boss farmer’s
ankles and out on the footbridge. There he stopped
to look worshipfully on his hero, his lord, his king,
Paul Bunyan, who shook hands solemnly with John
Shears.</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect ye to ketch me a frolickin’ with
one o’ my men,” said John Shears attempting a grin.
“But I do like to frolic once in a while, jest like your
loggers do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>“I’m glad that you have learned to play, John,”
said Paul Bunyan gently. “The playful spirit of my
loggers has helped them to bear untold perils, griefs
and hardships. They are a fine bunch of savages,
worthy of emulation. I intend for them to enjoy the
bounties and peace of home life for a season. We
return to log off the rest of the Smiling River country.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I’m mighty glad you’re to be with us
again, Mr. Bunyan,” said John Shears effusively.</p>

<p>“Thank you, John. And I wish to commend you
for your faithful service. I hope to reward you
fittingly. And I overlook your failure to ship Babe
his parsnips last fall. Your one failure, for which I
shall not reprove you. But you must prepare him
acres of them at once. Understand? Very well.
Yay, Babe!”</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger, the timekeeper, and the Big
Swede, the foreman, were beside Paul Bunyan. The
three moved towards the maple grove, and the blue ox,
who had been straddling the river, stepped on across
it, dragging the cookhouse, the bunkhouses, and the
other camp buildings behind him. He was thin, and
the shape of his great ribs showed through his shaggy
blue hide. As he moved through the twilight shadows
he looked like a wrinkled bluff when it is seen dimly in
a fog. For half an hour the bunkhouses flashed by
so swiftly that their lighted windows made an unbroken
streak of light. The loggers in them were
singing about the jam on Garry’s Rock and the death
of young Munro. As Little Meery listened to the
roaring choruses he felt that he would willingly give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
his life for a single day as a real logger. If he could
only be there in one of the bunkhouses, a tough and
respected member of a logging crew, a lean, supple,
vigorous axman, a fine and admired figure! Vain,
vain desire! Poor Little Meery. He abandoned the
dream with a sigh. Then he was startled by a dry,
rasping chuckle from John Shears. Little Meery was
astonished, for he had never heard the boss farmer
laugh.</p>

<p>“Parsnips, hey?” he cackled. “Ol’ Paul wants his
ox critter to have his parsnips right now, does he?
Dad gum’, ef that ain’t funny! Ho! ho!”</p>

<p>The boss farmer leaped over Honey Creek and
strode rapidly towards the farmhouse. Every hundred
yards he would pause and chuckle convulsively.
“Parsnips, hey? Ye dern’ tootin’ I’ll feet him
parsnips! It’s Mr. Bunyan’s pers’nal orders, says I.
Heh! heh! Dad burn’, ef that ain’t funny!”</p>

<p>While Paul Bunyan, Johnny Inkslinger and the Big
Swede cruised the remaining timber in the Smiling
River country, the loggers renewed their affections for
the delights of the old home camp. In the mornings
they roamed the cool slopes of old Rock Candy, they
gorged themselves with ripe fruit from the raspberry
trees and strawberry bushes, and, barefooted, they
climbed the maple trees and gamboled over the clover
fields. In the afternoons Smiling River was splashed
with foam for miles as they swarmed into their old
swimming holes. Swimming over, the loggers would
line up on the banks and shake their right legs to get
the water out of their left ears and their left legs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
get the water out of their right ears. Then they would
angle for the bright-hued butterfish that fluttered
among the water flowers. And what exhilarating
meals they enjoyed! Now they had all the fresh stuff
that the farm could provide. Cream Puff Fatty, the
baker, made them strawberry shortcake and raspberry
pie twice a day, and he covered these juicy
confections with snowy piles of vanilla-flavored
whipped cream. The cobs from golden, fat-kerneled
roasting ears were soon heaped mountain-high in the
kitchen yard. The cream gravy for the rosy new
potatoes and bouncing green peas was made from real
cream, sweet and thick. The loggers became lighthearted
boys again, and as they enjoyed themselves
they were happily unconscious of the bitter enviousness
of the scissor-bills, who were digging parsnips for
twenty hours a day on the other side of Honey Creek.</p>

<p>Babe, the blue ox, too, was enjoying life as never
before. The stream from the lemonade springs had
been diverted to a trough that ran through his manger;
and he was surrounded with fresh, green clover, for
John Shears, with sinister purpose, had mown all the
clover fields on the day after Paul Bunyan’s arrival
and had stacked it in and around Babe’s stable. He
had hoped that the blue ox would bloat on the green
feed, and perish before his master could return from
his cruising expedition. But the early harvest had
only served to throw the two bees into a rebellious
rage; they had been imprisoned in their hive, and
there, night and day, they had buzzed wrathfully over
their half-filled honey barrels. Babe digested the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
green clover easily, and ate it with delight, his great
blue eyes shining with affection and gratitude for the
boss farmer.</p>

<p>“Pity ’tain’t alfalfy, ye blame’ hog,” snarled John
Shears in disgust.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t, so John Shears made the scissor-bills
work twenty hours a day in the parsnip patch, and he
aided them with his own efforts, for he realized that
once Paul Bunyan and Johnny Inkslinger had returned
a fatal poisoning of the blue ox would be difficult
to accomplish. He would not have the courage
to attempt it then. Now was the time to strike.
Heaven helping him, he should not fail!</p>

<p>During this week Little Meery had been kept within
the bounds of the farmyard by the strict orders of John
Shears. His heart was heavy indeed as he toiled
away in the kitchen. Never had the scouring of pots
and pans seemed to be such wretched labor; never had
the odors and steam of dishwater seemed so detestable.
When he went out to slop the pigs at eventide he heard
the jaybirds’ songs no more; he had ears only for the
shouts, laughter and harmonies that sounded in the old
home camp. Next week the grand life of logging
would begin; all summer he, poor unfortunate, would
suffer the misery of vain longings. Poor Little Meery;
he looked in vain for a silver lining to his cloud.</p>

<p>Saturday came, and only one more holiday remained
for the loggers to enjoy. As Little Meery listened to
their exuberant noise, he was unable to drive away his
despondency with songs or cheerful thoughts. Hour
by hour his spirits got lower; his optimism left him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
and his mind was dark with dismal shades. When he
went to bed under the kitchen sink he did not fall into
a sound sleep at once, as he usually did; his misery
and dejection kept him awake. For two hours he lay
there, soaking his pillow with tears, then the droning
murmurs from the settin’-room were hushed, and, after
a pause, John Shears began a speech. He fully
revealed his frightful scheme to the scissor-bills, and
he exhorted them to be true to his cause, which was
their cause also. When Little Meery understood that
the boss farmer intended to poison the blue ox and
thus do away with the logging industry forever, he
gave such a start of horror that his head banged against
the bottom of the sink. The speech was halted at the
sound.</p>

<p>“It’s only Little Meery,” said a scissor-bill contemptuously.</p>

<p>Little Meery did not venture to stir again as John
Shears went on speaking.</p>

<p>“So it’s all fixed to pizen the ox critter to-night,”
said John Shears in conclusion. “Then they’ll be no
more wicked loggin’. Loggin’ must be wicked because
it makes wicked men. Farmin’ must be good because
it makes good men. When ol’ Paul Bunyan an’ his
loggers has to go farmin’ they’ll nacherlly turn into
good men. Then they’ll have to foller us, hi grabby,
because we was farmers an’ good men before they was.
I hate to pizen a pore dumb critter, but this here’s by
way of makin’ him a sackerfice—a sackerfice for the
glory of life eternal! Glory! glory! glory!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>The scissor-bills all shouted “Glory! glory! glory!”
after him, and then Little Meery heard them all move
out of the settin’-room. For a few minutes he did
not dare to stir, then he could no longer tolerate the
anxiety of waiting. He slid carefully from his bunk,
he took off his nightgown and slipped on his ragged
slavey’s clothes, and then, pausing cautiously at every
heavy step, he approached the kitchen door. He
opened it and peered outside. There was a fair light
from a half-moon, and he could see the scissor-bills
standing in rows and clusters along the barnyard
fence. John Shears was already across Honey Creek.
He opened the door of Babe’s stable, and then ran
back to the farmyard. Soon Babe’s head appeared in
the stable doorway, his great gentle eyes looked
inquiringly about, then they shone hungrily as they
glimpsed a white heap of the vegetables he loved.
Other piles were scattered at intervals of seven hundred
yards. In a short time Babe was in the parsnip
patch, and he began to devour the first mountainous
pile of the deadly vegetables. John Shears and the
scissor-bills shouted halleluiahs of joy and triumph.</p>

<p>Horror, despair, a terrible sense of helplessness,
held Little Meery motionless in the doorway. Hours
seemed to pass as he frantically tried to think of some
means to thwart the plot of John Shears and to ward
off the tragic event that was swiftly casting its shadow
over the old home camp. But what could <em>he</em> do? He
was only Little Meery, scorned, despised, held in such
contempt that he had been ignored entirely in the plans.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Then a sound that had roared in his ears ever since the
clover was cut for the blue ox startled his mind
with a desperate idea. The sound was the raging hum
of two great bees, Bum and Bill, and Little Meery
now resolved to release them from the hive, whatever
the danger to himself. He knew that they would
make a savage attack on the blue ox and perhaps drive
him from the perilous parsnip patch. So he eased
himself out of the kitchen and trod as softly as his
obesity permitted towards the beehive. He reached it
without being discovered, then he heaved up desperately
on the latch. Up it went—six inches, twelve,
eighteen, thirty-six, sixty—it was over the top of the
block! As Little Meery pantingly threw the door
open, the bees began to roar, then they shot out of the
hive with a deafening buzz, their wings humming
so violently that the wind from them stripped the
shirt off his back. The bees zigzagged doubtfully
for a moment, then they spied the blue ox in the
parsnip patch. They cracked their wings together
and lit out for him in a beeline. John Shears saw
them and bawled for them to return, but, though they
were obedient bees in their gentle moods, his yells now
made them buzz on in a greater rage than ever. They
circled the blue ox three times, then they sat on him
and began a furious stinging of him. Babe bellowed.
The scissor-bills were thrown through the barnyard
fence when the wind from that bellow struck them,
but John Shears charged through the vegetable gardens
after the bees. And reached the anguished ox just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
he had lifted his hind legs for a tremendous kick.
Babe’s hoof caught the boss farmer squarely between
his eyebrows and his ankles, and he was hurled so
high into the air that he sailed over the cloud-kissed
crest of old Rock Candy. Babe flailed away mightily
with his tail, he pawed up clouds of dirt, he stood on
his horns, but the bees remained seated. At last the
blue ox galloped out of the parsnip patch and ran for
the sanctuary of his stable, where the bees dared not
follow him.</p>

<p>Babe’s bellow had rolled Little Meery among the
scissor-bills, but he landed on his feet. He lumbered
away from them in the direction of the footbridge,
and when the scissor-bills had disentangled themselves
from the splinters of the fence, they set out after him.
They caught him in the center of the bridge, but just
as they were beginning to beat him, the loggers, who
had all been shaken from their bunks by Babe’s
anguished bellow, came with a rush from the other side.
Then began the famous Battle of the Footbridge, in
which the opposing forces vainly attempted to reach
each other over the obese form of Little Meery, who
received hundreds of blows a minute. All through the
night the battle raged, while Babe mooed woefully in
his stable and Bum and Bill buzzed gleeful satisfaction
in their hive.</p>

<p>Not until sunrise, when Paul Bunyan reached the
old home camp, was the terrible struggle ended. He
ordered the loggers and the scissor-bills into the plain
before the maple grove and demanded an explanation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
The combatants were too weary from their terrific
struggle to reply, but at last Little Meery found
strength to speak and told his awful story.</p>

<p>“Brave, brave heart,” Paul Bunyan commended
him. “And how can I reward you?”</p>

<p>“I want to be a head faller, Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>“But a head faller must fit into a head faller’s uniform,
and you my fine lad—well, you are Little
Meery.”</p>

<p>Then Little Meery staggered triumphantly from
among the weary host. Not a stitch remained on
him, he was bruised from head to heels, but he showed
himself with pride. For he was not now the seven
hundred and eighty pound Little Meery of yesterday,
but a raw-boned two hundred and fifty pound logger,
lean, solid and strong. During the long battle, pound
by pound, over a quarter of a ton of fat had been
pushed, prodded, punched, pounded, rolled, jerked,
squeezed and stamped from his body. His obesity
was gone! Miracle of miracles! Paul Bunyan could
hardly believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“A head faller you shall be,” he said.</p>

<p>John Shears was three weeks returning from the
spot whither Babe had kicked him. Meek, humble,
chastened, repentant, he came to Paul Bunyan and
declared himself willing to submit to the dire punishment
which he supposed awaited him. He expected
to be made to eat gravel for a month, at the very least.
The good and mighty Paul Bunyan, however, merely
ordered John Shears to get back to the farm. But he
put a ban on parsnips. As for Little Meery, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
heard that John Shears had returned, he twisted his
hat around—his hair was never parted now,—he took
a grand chew of fire cut, hitched up his tin pants and
growled. “Let’s walk on him! Let’s put the calks
to him! Let’s cave his head in!” Little Meery had
become a logger indeed, and he lived gloriously ever
after.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_132">SHANTY BOY</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> Paul Bunyan’s time, camp entertainment was of,
by and for the woodsmen. In Paul Bunyan’s camp
there were hypnotic story-tellers, singers who could
make you laugh and cry in the same moment, and
steppers who could do a breakdown fit to shatter the
frame of a bunkhouse. “Ol’ Paul” knew the importance
of social pleasures for his loggers, and he made
natural provision for them. A good bunkhouse bard
was marked by the great logger’s especial favor; many
a man who toiled poorly was saved from the lowly
life of a farm hand by his ability to dance, whistle
and sing. Consequently Paul Bunyan’s Bunkhouse
Nights are as famous in history as his great feasts and
labors.</p>

<p>Every night but Sunday, when the twelve hours of
toil in the woods were ended and supper was over, the
tired loggers would be cheered and consoled by the
bunkhouse bards. There was one for each shanty, and
each one had his own particular virtues. There was
Beeg An’tole, for example, who made his mates in
Bunkhouse 999 hilarious as he told quaint tales about
logging in “dat ver’ fines’ countree, which she’s t’ree
weeks below Quebec.” Angus MacIlroy of Bunkhouse
1313 was made to sing “The Island Boys” a
dozen times a night by his song-loving comrades.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
And Tinty Hoolan of Bunkhouse 6000 jigged with
such violence and speed that a modern jazz band
would have gone crazy trying to make music fast
enough for him. The rattle of his jigging feet
sounded like the buzz of a big bee. His bunkhouse
cronies boasted that he could imitate any known sound
with his feet except a tired logger’s snore. And this,
anyone admitted, defied imitation or description.
Tinty Hoolan was a swamper, and a poor one; his
feet, however, saved him from life among the scissor-bills
on Paul Bunyan’s farm.</p>

<p>Now these were three of the greatest of Paul Bunyan’s
bards, and no one has ever found words
to describe them or to give them fitting praise. And
if words fail with them, how can they reveal the
brightest star of all Paul Bunyan’s performers? Indeed,
Shanty Boy, of Bunkhouse 1, was more than
a star; he was a constellation, for he was an entertainer
with a thousand talents. What old logger does not
feel his own soul dance as he hears, in the Bunyan
histories, the soft, vibrant patter of Shanty Boy’s right
foot, the thunderous stamp of his left foot, the sharp
rattle of his heel-cracking in a great breakdown? He
not only danced with his feet, but with his hands and
eyes; he had a dancing grin, too, which would shine
now on the right side of his face, now on the left.
Shanty Boy put his whole soul into his dancing. And
so he did with his stories. When he told a Swede
story he <em>was</em> a Swede, and when he told a dirty story
he <em>was</em> dirty. He was never content with mere pretending.
He made entertainment of everything, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
he did it naturally. A log would roll over his leg
when he was at work. That night he would hobble
down the bunkhouse aisle like an ailing old man, talking
in the mournfullest way. “Oh, lawdy, boys! I
’low I ain’t long fer <em>this</em> life. Thet new medicine I’m
usin’ don’t ’pear to be doin’ my rheumatiz no good, no
good a-tall. I spect I’ll be havin’ to change to ’nuther
kind agin.” Then he’d hobble back again, drawing
his sore leg up like a string-halted horse, and groaning,
“M-m-m-! M-m-m! I ’low I feel worse’n anyone
thet ever lived in this here world—an’ lived.” If
somebody asked him what time it was, he would take
out his old watch, hold it at arm’s length, throw back
his head and squint at the watch like he was looking
at it through glasses. He claimed that “grandpap
carried thet watch fer nigh on forty year, an’ it won’t
tell the time onless I look at it jest like he did.”
Sometimes he would sit down by the stove and eat an
apple or a raw turnip. Then he would pull his hat
down over his eyes, and while he chewed away, looking
as solemn as a politician, he would make the hat bob
up and down to keep time with his jaws. No one else
could have done this without seeming foolish, but
Shanty Boy always kept a kind of dignity when he
was performing that made men respect him even when
they were laughing at him.</p>

<p>But it was his songs and stories which truly
endeared him to the loggers. His renditions of “John
Ross,” “Jack Haggerty,” “The Island Boys,” and
“Bung Yer Eye,” were so affecting and inspiring that
the loggers, what with laughing, crying, stamping,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
clapping and cheering, often made so much sympathetic
noise that the song itself could not be heard.
Shanty Boy only sang two nights a week and then
for no longer than four hours at a time. The other
nights he danced, and told true but thrilling stories of
life in the woods. The bards from other bunkhouses
would come to hear him and then give imitations of
his performances. His supremacy was unquestioned,
yet he remained unspoiled.</p>

<p>For he was more than a mere entertainer. The
mightiest of Paul Bunyan’s loggers lived in Bunkhouse
1, and as a logger Shanty Boy was the peer of any of
them. He could notch a tree or work in white water
with the best of the fallers and rivermen. He held
his own with even Mark Beaucoup in the rough bunkhouse
frolics. He was Paul Bunyan’s favorite faller,
and the great logger often carried him to the woods on
his shoulder. He had an equal rank with Hot Biscuit
Slim, the chief cook, Shagline Bill, the freighter,
and Big Ole, the blacksmith. He was a true hero.
And a time came when he reached the greatest height
of glory ever attained by a plain logger. Here is how
it came about.</p>

<p>The Year of the Two Winters had been disastrous
for Paul Bunyan. Winter had come again in the
summertime that year, and the cold increased in the
succeeding months. At Christmas time there was
fifty feet of ice on Lake Michigan, and by the
last of February the lake was frozen to the bottom.
Paul Bunyan was then engaged in logging off the Peninsula
country, and of course his operations were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
halted. He cut the ice into blocks and hauled them
out on the lake shore with Babe, his big blue ox, who
could pull anything that had two ends on it. This
was done so that the ice would melt more quickly
when normal summer weather returned. Then he
moved his outfit to the old home camp in the Smiling
River country, where severe weather was never experienced.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan had done no logging around his old
home camp for seven years. The remaining timber
was so far from the river and on such steep hills that
profitable logging seemed impossible. However, it
was the best to be had, for elsewhere it would be weeks,
even months, before the snow drifts would melt away
from the tree tops. Paul Bunyan tackled the tough
logging problems before him with characteristic
courage. He was sure that his inventiveness and
resourcefulness would, as always, triumph over every
obstacle.</p>

<p>His most stubborn and difficult problem was that
of getting the loggers to the woods in the morning in
time to do any work and getting them home at night
in time to do any sleep. One plan after another was
tried and dropped, failures all. Paul Bunyan began
with an attempt to work one day shift, but the loggers
could not get to the woods before lunch time; lunch
finished, they had to start at once for the camp. Two
shifts were then put on, but little work could be done
at night, except when the moon was full. Paul
Bunyan then sent the great Johnny Inkslinger, his
timekeeper and man of science, to investigate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Aurora Borealis as a means of artificial lighting.
Johnny reported that it was pretty but unreliable, and
he doubted if even the blue ox could move it down
from the North in less than six months. The learned
Inkslinger then sat down and figured desperately for
a week, trying to devise a method of working three
twelve-hour shifts a day. With such a routine one
shift could be doing a day’s work, while a second shift
was coming to work, and a third was going to camp.
Johnny Inkslinger was, beyond a doubt, the greatest
man with figures that ever lived, but here his mathematics
failed him. Paul Bunyan then thought of
making a campsite in the timber, and he dug for water
in the high hills. He succeeded in reaching a mighty
vein, but it was so deep that it took a week to draw a
bucket of water out of the well. It was out of the
question as a water supply for the camp.</p>

<p>Now Paul Bunyan had to fall back on a last plan,
a far-fetched one that seemed well-nigh hopeless.
This was to build a great sled, something on the order
of a lunch sled, and have Babe, the blue ox, haul the
loggers to and from work each day. It was a desperate
plan, and no one but Paul Bunyan would have
had the courage to attempt it. It must be remembered
that the blue ox measured forty-two ax handles and a
plug of chewing tobacco between the horns; an
ordinary man at his front had to use a telescope to see
what he was doing with his hind legs, he was so long;
he had so much energy and such delight in labor that
no one could hold him when he started for the woods in
the mornings; he was so fast that Paul Bunyan’s foreman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the Big Swede, who was as tall as the trees, could
not begin to keep up with him. Only Paul Bunyan
could travel so fast. Whenever Babe moved the camp
he traveled at a careful pace, but even then some of
the loggers were made seasick; and all of them became
so irritable when a move was being made that they
fought constantly among themselves. If the comparatively
slow camp-moving pace of the blue ox thus upset
them, his timber-going gallop would be apt to ruin
them completely. Paul Bunyan remembered how the
Big Swede, hanging to Babe’s halter rope, was hurled
through the air, only striking the ground once in every
quarter of a mile or so, when the blue ox rushed to his
delightful labor each morning. A lunch sled full of
loggers would be dragged by Babe in much the same
fashion; it would be in the air most of the time, and
when it did strike the ground loggers would be
scattered like autumn leaves. The loggers who would
hang on until the woods were reached would have the
living daylights shaken out of them. A common
lunch sled would not do; one must be invented that
would hold the road.</p>

<p>So Paul Bunyan devised the serpentine bobsled.
It was a long, low-built contraption; the runners were
made in short sections, connected by double joints.
When it was completed and lay in the road that led
from the camp it looked like a squat fence, for it
snugly fitted the contours of the hills and vales over
which it extended.</p>

<p>“There’s a rig that’ll hold the road,” said Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Bunyan with pride. “Now I’ll invent something
equally good to hold Babe to a slow pace.”</p>

<p>Several mechanical devices were tried without
passing the first test. The sled lay idle. The loggers
got sore feet, and they traveled so slowly that they
began to take twelve hours to reach the woods. There
was one shift on the road, going, and one coming all of
the time. Not a tree was being felled.</p>

<p>“There’s no way out of it but to try the grizzlies,”
Paul Bunyan told his timekeeper.</p>

<p>Among the other livestock on Paul Bunyan’s farm,
which was down the river from the old home camp,
was a herd of grizzly bears. The great logger often
amused himself by playing with them, and he had
taught them many tricks. Not the least of their
stunts was for each bear to hang from a tree with three
paws and try to claw Paul Bunyan’s mackinaw with
the other paw as he dodged by.</p>

<p>“I’ll station them at the trees which are left standing
along the road,” said Paul Bunyan, “and when Babe
roars by they’ll hook him. They may only frighten
him into a faster run, but I think surely they’ll slow
him down.”</p>

<p>The next morning the loggers, for the most part,
joyfully crawled upon the serpentine bobsled. The
timid and cranky among the loggers were pessimistic,
of course, and declared noisily that this would be the
end of them. But Shanty Boy and the other bards
laughed at their fears, and at last every logger in
camp was on the sled. Paul Bunyan ordered the Big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Swede to hitch up the blue ox and start in half an
hour, and he departed for the woods with his herd of
grizzlies. He stationed one of them at every tree
close to the road. When he reached the timber he
straddled a hogback and sat down to wait for the
outcome of his daring attempt.</p>

<p>In a short time he heard a faint thunder down in
the valley, then he saw enormous balloons of dust
twisting up in cyclonic bursts from the foothills, next
he heard the crashing sound of hoofbeats that got
louder and louder.... Through clouds of dust he
saw Babe’s tail brush lifted like a triumphal banner
and the glitter of his horns.... The Big Swede,
hanging to Babe’s halter rope, soared and dived....</p>

<p>The bears had failed. Indeed, they had failed
terribly, for when Babe came to a halt in the timber
Paul Bunyan saw bears paws hanging from both sides
of him. Only one bear had saved his paw, and he
was holding a tree in a frenzied clutch. Babe had
carried away bear, tree and all. Paul Bunyan rushed
back over the road, and as he came to each unfortunate
grizzly he mercifully dispatched him. He carried
them all into camp.</p>

<p>“Bear meat for Sunday dinner,” he said to Hot
Biscuit Slim, as he threw the bears into the kitchen
yard.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan then had Johnny Inkslinger bring his
medicine case, and the two hurried to the woods. But
only a slight number of the loggers had been made
truly ill by the terrific speed with which Babe had
hauled them over the hills. The double-jointed sled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
runners had slipped over rocks, logs and gullies as
easily as a snake glides over a string. Not once had
the sled bounded from the road. Not a logger had
suffered a jolt. Some of them were dazed and
breathless, others were choked with dust, but most of
them were no more than badly scared by their terrific
journey.</p>

<p>“Aye tal you it ban no use try hol’ Babe down,”
said the Big Swede, with rare eloquence.</p>

<p>“The sled worked perfectly, at any rate,” said Paul
Bunyan. “We can depend on it. But those good
bullies of mine are going to need a lot of encouragement
to stand that ride every morning.”</p>

<p>He was quite right. His loggers thought nothing
of the perils of falling limbs, which are called “widow-makers”
to-day in the woods. Breaking up log jams,
jumping rolling logs, dodging butts of trees which
bucked back from the stumps when they fell—all
this was in the day’s work. But even the serpentine
bobsled could not banish the terrors of riding behind
the blue ox each morning. “I’d ruther try ridin’ a
peavy handle down the West Branch.” “I’ll tell
you Babe went so fast I acshuly <em>seen</em> the wind, an’ I
never seen anything more sickenin’ in my life!”
“What if Babe ud a throwed a shoe now? I bet it
’da tore through us like a cannon ball!”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan frowned as he hearkened to their
complaints. His loggers seldom thought of anything
but their labor when they were in the woods. If they
were complaining now, what would happen when the
bunkhouse cranks got into action after supper? There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
would be much gloomy grumbling, and perhaps rebellious
talk. When the loggers went to bed they would
brood over the cyclonic morning ride instead of getting
fortifying sleep. Then they would soon balk against
riding behind the blue ox. To avoid such an event
he must call on his bards to cajole, humor and inspire
the men until he could devise new methods to solve
his logging problems. With this idea in mind he took
Shanty Boy aside, placed him on his knee and explained
the situation.</p>

<p>“I shore will do my best,” said Shanty Boy. “But
looky here, Mr. Bunyan, I ’low I’ll have to lie to ’em
right smart.”</p>

<p>“How so, my lad?”</p>

<p>“Well I’ve alus done the best I knowed how when
I set out to be amusin’. So, if I’m goin’ to make my
stories any thicker, I’ll jest about have to stir a few
lies into ’em.”</p>

<p>“Son, nobody loves a liar.”</p>

<p>“Thet’s jest it, Mr. Bunyan. I got a powerful
good reppytation fer truth, an’ I can lie quite a spell
afore I’m ketched. But if I do get ketched Mark
Beaucoup an’ them Rories’ll chaw me up. You’ve
learnt all the loggers to hate lyin’ jest like you do yourself.
I’d probably get spiled if I was ketched. Besides,
I jest nacherly hate to lie. Yet, no lyin’, no
loggin’, seems to be the fact o’ the matter.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan pondered doubtfully for some time.
Moral issues baffled him always. But at last he spoke
with decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>“Logging must go on. You may lie, if necessary,
during the period of emergency.”</p>

<p>“Them’s orders, Mr. Bunyan. But what if the
gang gets hostile an’ starts to chaw me up?”</p>

<p>Again Paul Bunyan hesitated. It was against his
policy to interfere in the logger’s personal affairs.
Then, firmly:</p>

<p>“A man with your talent should not have to lie,
Shanty Boy, in order to entertain his mates. But you
know best, of course. If you are discovered, tell the
men that all complaints must be lodged with me before
they act upon them. Be cautious and discreet, and
honor and glory shall be yours.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir. Thank ye, sir, Mr. Bunyan.”</p>

<p>Shanty Boy went bravely to work carrying out the
great logger’s commands. For some time it was not
necessary to tell more than two or three lies a week
in order to take the logger’s thoughts off their sickening
morning rides. They were not great lies that he told,
either, but only plausible exaggerations. Most of his
stories were still true ones, and he told them better
than ever. He inspired the visiting bards as never
before. Each night he sent his mates smilingly to
sleep, entirely forgetful of the ordeal that awaited
them in the morning. But this was not natural, and
of course it couldn’t last. The loggers lost weight
every day, and they began to complain of hurts in
their innards. The bunkhouse cranks got their dismal
chorus started, and Shanty Boy had to tell real
big lies to hush it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>He lied wonderfully indeed, once he was well
started. He got so funny that the loggers had to strap
themselves into their bunks while they listened to him.
They went to sleep laughing, as a rule, and the night
long they would chuckle in their dreams.</p>

<p>Shanty Boy grew bolder with success. He told,
with a bare face, stories about snakes that had many
joints, and how they would separate into pieces and
crawl a dozen ways at once. He called them joint
snakes. He told stories about a snake that would put
its tail in its mouth and roll down hill. He called
it a hoop snake. When the loggers got a little tired
of snakes, he told whoppers about possums, then about
coons, and so on. At last he got around to fish, and
he told so many good fish stories that the loggers
would not let him switch to another subject. He ran
out of ideas, but the loggers would not let him get
away from fish.</p>

<p>One night as he was trying desperately to invent a
tolerable lie about fish he remembered a story of a
whale that he had heard his grandfather tell, insisting
that it was the gospel truth. It was the old story
about Jonah and the whale, and the loggers had never
heard it. They became indignant when Shanty Boy
repeated it for the plain truth, and some of them
began to shout at him. For the first time in his life
he got stage fright. He felt that he was telling the
gospel truth, but the memory of his previous lies
overwhelmed him. He tried vainly to continue his
narrative about Jonah’s life in the whale’s belly, but
his tongue failed. He dropped his head, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
fixed a shamed gaze on his feet. First he heard
nothing but the pounding of his heart; then an angry
mutter ran along the bunks. It grew into a fierce
growl. Then Shanty Boy heard the tramp of feet,
and he looked up to see Mark Beaucoup and the
bunkhouse cranks advancing upon him.</p>

<p>“She’s lie!” yelled Mark Beaucoup. “<i lang="fr">Sacre!</i> but
she’s tell a beeg wan.”</p>

<p>He shook a huge brown fist under Shanty Boy’s nose.</p>

<p>“Now you are feex yourself. Stan’ up w’ile I
knock you down!”</p>

<p>The loggers left their bunks and made a pressing
crowd around their discomfited bard and his challenger.</p>

<p>“I was coun’ for you stan’ up. <span class="locked">Wan—two—t’ree——”</span></p>

<p>Then Shanty Boy remembered Paul Bunyan’s “All
complaints must be lodged with me” and courage
returned to him.</p>

<p>“You bunkhouse cranks shore give me a misery,”
he said contemptuously. “You jest go an’ tell my
story to ol’ Paul an’ see what <em>he</em> says about it.”</p>

<p>The loggers stared at him with amazement.</p>

<p>“By gar!” exclaimed Mark Beaucoup. “De fool
wan’ me tell dees to ol’ Paul! She’s wan’ me tell
dees, dat crazy t’ing!”</p>

<p>“Thet’s what I said,” growled Shanty Boy. “Run
along afore I get into one o’ my tantrums.”</p>

<p>Knowing Paul Bunyan’s furious opinion of liars, the
loggers were smitten with horror. Of course this
story might not be a lie, but most likely it was, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
what old Paul would do to him for telling it! Mark
Beaucoup was triumphant. Soon Bunkhouse 1 would
have another king; it should know a rule of iron
instead of laughter.</p>

<p>“Come wit’ me,” he commanded his friends. The
other loggers, except Shanty Boy, followed them to
Paul Bunyan.</p>

<p>As Paul Bunyan listened to Mark Beaucoup he was
struck with a powerful regret for having inspired his
greatest bard to leave the path of truthful narration.
Desperate circumstances had seemed to justify the
step. But what a risk he had taken just to save a
few weeks logging! The faith his loggers had in him
lay in the balance. Now it seemed that he must lose
this faith or sacrifice a hero. He had never dreamed
that Shanty Boy would recklessly tell such an incredible
story. Surely he had not told it unthinkingly.
No doubt he could explain it. Paul Bunyan sent for
him.</p>

<p>It was with a heavy heart that the great bard walked
through the lines of silent, accusing loggers. It
looked like the end of everything for him. But he
kept his courage, and, as he walked slowly on, his
nimble mind was leaping from idea to idea, seeking
a solid defense. But what proof could he offer for
such a story? His grandfather <em>knew</em> it was true, but
the old man was far away in the Southern mountains.
He alone must prove somehow that he had not
lied.... Paul Bunyan’s boots loomed before him....
He must think hard ... hard....</p>

<p>“This story must be <em>explained</em>,” said Paul Bunyan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
in a stern voice, at the same time flashing him a look
of the utmost sympathy.</p>

<p>“I ’low the story is beyond explainin’, Mr. Bunyan,
but I never lied when I told it,” said Shanty Boy,
bravely.</p>

<p>“Prove it!” roared Mark Beaucoup and his followers.</p>

<p>Shanty Boy drew himself up pridefully and he fixed
upon the multitude a gaze of lofty scorn.</p>

<p>“I never lied!” he declared. “I never lied, for
when I lie my neck <em>it swells</em>! An’—now—look!”</p>

<p>He jerked open the collar of his shirt and exposed
his muscular throat. There was not a sign of swelling
about it. The loggers lifted a mighty cheer, and Mark
Beaucoup, baffled, beaten, completely outwitted, could
only swear:</p>

<p>“She’s don’ swell—by gar!—she’s don’ swell!”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan could not restrain a windy sigh of
relief. The trees bent before the blast and dust clouds
rolled through the ranks of loggers. Now was the
moment to complete the victory.</p>

<p>“Get to your bunkhouses!” Paul Bunyan roared.</p>

<p>Shanty Boy was carried on the shoulders of yelling
admirers to Bunkhouse 1. Mark Beaucoup and the
bunkhouse cranks did not venture to follow them until
the lights had gone out. Then, humbled and quiet,
they sneaked into their bunks.</p>

<p>As a result of his troubles Paul Bunyan came near
to abandoning logging operations in the Smiling River
Country. But one night he got an idea, an idea so
simple and sound that he was astonished at not thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
of it before. He put it into practice at once, and
when the loggers awoke the next morning they saw
wooded hills at the very door of the camp. Paul
Bunyan had simply thrown a cable around each hill,
and the blue ox, who could pull anything that had a
top on it, had snaked every one into camp. So the
logging then went on easily until the new summer had
melted the ice and snow and Lake Michigan was filled
with water once more, and had new fish in it.</p>

<p>Shanty Boy’s triumph was complete. Not only did
he have great honors from Paul Bunyan, but his mates
now revered as well as admired him. His ventures
from truth had held off revolt from the bunkhouses.
He had convinced the loggers of the truth of the grand
old story of Jonah and the whale. And he had made
them all fear swelled necks as the result of lying.
This last effect persists to this day, for everywhere
loggers are still known as the most truthful of men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_149">THE KINGDOM OF KANSAS</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">No</span> region of Real America, save Kansas, boasted of
its weather in Paul Bunyan’s time. In the heyday of
the mighty logger the climates and seasons were not
systematized; they came and went and behaved without
rule or reason. There were many years with two
winters, and sometimes all four seasons would come
and go in one month. The wind would frequently
blow straight up and then straight down. Sometimes
it would simply stand still and blow in one place. In
its most prankish moods it would blow all ways at
once. The weather was indeed powerful strange in
those days and it got itself talked about. And nowhere
were its ways more evil than in Utah.</p>

<p>When Paul Bunyan moved his camp to the state of
Utah for the purpose of logging off its forests of stonewood
trees he was not careless of the climate; he merely
failed to suspect its treachery. Besides, other troubles
beset him. The gritty texture of the stonewood
timber dulled the edge of an ax bit in two strokes.
At the end of their twelve-hour day in the woods the
loggers had to sharpen axes for seven hours. They
were always fagged out. Then there was only one
small river near the forests, and Babe, the blue ox, who
had got hayfever again since coming West, drank it
dry every fifteen minutes. The loggers thirsted, and
they were bedeviled by sand in their blankets and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
the beans, for every time Babe sneezed he raised a
dust storm that rolled its clouds through the cookhouse
and the bunkhouses and covered the great plain and
the hills around the camp. A spirit of dark and evil
melancholy settled on the loggers.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan hoped for an adequate water supply
from the December snows. And he brought all his
inventive powers to the problem of felling the stonewood
trees. In eleven days and nights he devised
eight hundred and five systems, machines and implements,
and from this galaxy he selected a noble
tool.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan’s new invention was the double-bitted
ax, which is used everywhere in the woods to-day.
Paul Bunyan devised it so that a faller could chop with
one blade, then twist the handle and whet the other
blade on the gritty stonewood with the backward
swing.</p>

<p>But even with the new axes the logging went on
slowly. The camp supply of elbow grease gave out,
and the loggers suffered stiffened joints. The December
snows were light, and the thirsty blue ox continued
to drink the entire water supply. The bunkhouses
came to be dens of ominous brooding and quiet instead
of gay and noisy habitations. Finally the shipment
of webfooted turkeys from the Great Lakes arrived too
late for Christmas dinner. The loggers became dour,
gaunt, embittered men.</p>

<p>Then came New Year’s Day and outrageous fortune.
When the loggers went to work at the first thinning
of darkness they attributed the peculiar oppressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
warmth of the morning to an unusual Chinook wind.
There was, however, no wind at all. Then the rising
sun shot blazing rays into a cloudless sky. Even then
the loggers did not realize that they were witnessing
an Event. This was the beginning of a notable year,
the Year of the Hot Winter. As the sun climbed
higher the heat grew more intense. The Christmas
snow had vanished at the first burning touch of day.
The ground baked and cracked. The stonewood trees
glittered in a fierce light. Each logger threw off his
mackinaw, muffler, sweater, stagged shirt, woolen
overshirt and undershirt; his paraffin pants, mackinaw
pants and overalls and his Arctic socks, heavy wool
socks, light wool socks and cotton socks. All heavy
clothing was speedily thrown aside, and everywhere
in the plain, in the valleys, and on the hillsides were
piles of garments, and by each pile a logger toiled, clad
only in drawers and calked boots. But still sweat
dripped and trickled from their bodies; they labored
more and more languorously. Each quarter of an
hour the blue ox, with lolling tongue, dashed madly
for the river and drank it dry.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan was distressed by this change in his
affairs, but he was not daunted. Confident that his
loggers would do their best in the meanwhile, he again
retired to solitude, hoping to devise something that
would conquer the hostile and unnatural season. He
returned with the great timber scythe, with which he
could fell a full section of timber with one swing of
his mighty arms. Carrying the timber scythe over
his shoulder, Paul Bunyan strode toward his camp.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
His tread was vigorous despite the deadening heat.
Benevolent ideas stirred his heart. He himself would
do the arduous labor of felling the stonewood trees;
the loggers would be asked only to do the lighter
work of trimming and bucking the trees into logs.
They were a fine bunch of savages; ordinarily they
would not allow even Paul Bunyan to do their natural
work. Perhaps they would resist such intrusion
now. But the great logger was sure of his persuasive
powers.</p>

<p>As he neared the camp, busy as he was with philanthropic
thoughts, he failed to note an unusual silence
in the woods and about the bunkhouses. Not until
he saw Babe and the Big Swede sleeping in the stable
was he made aware of the extraordinary. Paul
Bunyan went next to the camp office. Johnny Inkslinger,
that tower of energy, was sleeping at his desk!
His fountain pen had dropped from his hand, and as
it was fed by hose lines from twenty-five barrels of ink,
a black stream gushed from its point and flooded the
floor. A chorus of faint snores came from each bunkhouse.
The cookhouse looked gloomy and deserted.
In the woods the axes and saws lay where the loggers
had left them. For one hundred and seventy-nine
minutes Paul Bunyan stood silently in the midst of
his camp, tormented by wrath, regret and sorrow.
His outfit had failed him. After all these years of
comradeship in labor they had allowed a mere hot
winter to provoke them into faithlessness. He had
left them without an idea that they would be untrue
to the job while he was scheming to make it a success.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
But they had weakened. Very well, he thought,
after his brief period of emotion, he would perform
their labor for them while they snored. They should
awaken to shame.</p>

<p>One stride brought him into the first clearing made
among the stonewood trees. Without losing a second,
he threw the timber scythe from his shoulder, he
grasped its handles, then took a long swing, and the
first section of trees thundered to the ground. On he
went, making a circular swath. As he stepped with his
right foot the sharp scythe blade crashed through the
trees on the cutting stroke, and as he stepped with his
left he brought the scythe behind him with a vigorous
swing. On and on he labored, his steps coming
faster as the circle widened. Every seven hours he
paused to whet the blade of the timber scythe on a
bundle of the stonewood trees which he carried in his
hip pocket. The hot winter drove its fires upon him,
but his passion of toil repelled them with a stronger
flame. The great logger’s walk became a run; the
dazzling blade of the timber scythe flashed in strokes
of inconceivable rapidity; the sections of stonewood
trees fell in a steady roar.</p>

<p>Then Paul Bunyan began to sweat. He had
labored before this, but never so savagely, nor in such
penetrating heat. Only the man who raises a good
sweat for the first time can realize what an astounding
store of perspiration the human body can hold. On
occasion it gushes from innumerable springs, seeming
inexhaustible. It streams down the crevices and
valleys of the body and floods the flat spaces; it soaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
the clothing and drips to the ground. Imagine then
what happened when Paul Bunyan’s stored perspiration
was unloosed. As he toiled on, ever more
fiercely, his sweat flooded his boots, it surged over their
tops and foamed towards the ground like two
Niagaras. His swinging body and flying arms flung
out clouds of spray. These strange waters coursed
over the plains in torrents and gathered in heaving
pools. The little river was submerged, drowned,
exterminated. The waters crept towards the camp.
Paul Bunyan, more and more engrossed with his labor
as time went on, did not note the rising flood. His
circle grew wider and wider. It left the plain and
swung around the bordering slopes. Section after
section of the trees was felled, only to be covered by
water, for the stonewood timber was too heavy to float.
But Paul Bunyan labored around and around the
circle, quite unaware of the tragical consequence of his
efforts.</p>

<p>For five days and nights the loggers lay in their
bunks, too lazy to get up to eat, too lazy to do aught
but drowse and dream. But at twelve o’clock on the
fifth night the waters had reached the bunkhouses, and
they learned of their peril. Yells of fear arose from
every quarter, and in a few moments the whole camp,
with the exception of Babe, the Big Swede, and
Johnny Inkslinger, was aroused. Fright made the
loggers forget the hot winter, and gave them energy.
When they looked out on a vast lake glittering in the
moonlight, and saw in the dim distance the twin rivers
roaring from Paul Bunyan’s boots, they knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
speedy and efficient action was necessary to save their
lives. The best swimmers swam out to the tool house
and brought back hammers, saws and nails. Each
logger then began to build a boat from his bunk, and
for three hours they worked feverishly and silently
constructing the vessels. When the last one was
finished the word was passed along and in a few
moments the boats, each one carrying a logger and
his blankets, swarmed from the bunkhouses. Before
the armada had gone twenty feet the boats all filled
with water and sank, while the loggers uttered
lamentable cries. These changed to sounds of rejoicing,
however, when it was discovered that the
water was only waist deep. The loggers rescued
their bundles from the boats and scampered to the
shore like a holiday host at a beach.</p>

<p>But their joy did not last; it quickly gave way to
dread. Paul Bunyan, toiling more desperately every
moment, was rapidly moving around the circle. In a
short time he would be upon them, and at any instant
he might discover the fate of his trees, the flooding of
his camp, his complete disaster. The loggers all
understood the reason for the mighty man’s wrathful
labor. Their sense of blame confused them and
smothered their native courage. The host began to
move over the hills, haltingly at first, and with heads
bowed like penitents. Then, as the volleying thunder
of Paul Bunyan’s timber scythe sounded nearer and
nearer, they lifted their heads and struck a faster pace.
Then guilty fears possessed them and every logger of
the lot began to gallop madly. Someone yelled, “Ol’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Paul’s a comin’!” and the warning cry was echoed
from thousands of throats all over the hills. The
loggers were taken by panic; the runaway became a
stampede. By dawn they were making such running
leaps that each logger would hit his chin with his front
knee and his head with his back heel at every stride.
They were so scared that they never stopped until they
got to Kansas.</p>

<p>Now Kansas at that time had the only kingdom
that was ever known to exist in this country. The
ruler of Kansas was King Bourbon, and Topeka was
his capital. The Kansas country was then one of the
pleasantest in Real America. It was rolling land, like
that everywhere else, but its heavy vegetation and its
forests were beautiful and unique, and the climate
and seasons were always spring; and indeed the history
of Paul Bunyan’s time tells of a year in Kansas that
had thirteen months of spring.</p>

<p>The forests were mostly whisky trees, which grew
amid carpets of cigarette grass and were entwined with
beervines. The greatest of these forests was around
Lake Topeka, and by the lake was the capital city,
where the nobility and gentry of Kansas led a pleasurable
life and envied no one.</p>

<p>When Paul Bunyan’s loggers reached Kansas they
were so exhausted from their long run that they had no
eyes for the beauties of that region; they only felt that
it invited them to rest and promised them security.
So when they came to the banks of Rolling River they
dropped on the soft and fragrant masses of cigarette
grass, and rested in the cool shade of the spreading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
whisky trees, with the bliss known only to the utterly
weary. For a long while they were not aware of the
virile odors of the beervine blossoms, and they heard
but faintly the melodies of the huge but gentle piano
birds who were everywhere in the forest, either flitting
from bough to bough or sitting in their nests. And
even when they were rested and soothed by the sweet
airs and tinkling melodies the loggers enjoyed the
originality of their environment but a short while, for
each one became conscious of a raging hunger.</p>

<p>“Let’s look for a nose bag!” the cry up and down the
columns and lines. The loggers all arose with the
intent of foraging in the forest, and they would no
doubt have appeased their hunger at once, if an
impulsive curiosity had not made them take a last
look at the river. A great gasp of astonishment went
up, then a terrific crash of laughter shook the vast forest
and silenced the piano birds. The loggers, one and
all, dropped again to the ground and rolled and
bounced about in convulsions of merriment.</p>

<p>Rolling River was a stubborn and valiant stream,
and, unlike tamer rivers, it refused to follow the easiest
course. From its source extended a range of hills
which decreased in height until it was merged in the
slope of a far valley. Rolling River made its way up
and down these hills, cleaving each summit. At the
place where the loggers were resting the river always
had a hard fight, as one hill was nearly equal in height
to the one that preceded it. Sometimes Rolling River
would fail here; the waters would part at the summit,
and one end of the river would go rushing on and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
other end would slide back down the hill for a fresh
start.</p>

<p>It was then that the giddyfish which dwelt in this
stream would perform so clownishly as to tickle any
observer into fits. Bewildered by the waters’ abrupt
desertion of them, and perplexed as to which end of
the river it was best to follow, numbers of them would
hesitate on the hilltop, agitated and floundering, then
half of them would take out after the lower end of
the river and half of them would take out after the
upper end. They could make great speed by leaping
along like kangaroos, using their long fins and tails.
But they traveled clumsily, and their limber tongues
lolled from their mouths as they leaped down the hillside,
all of which made their every action seem
inexpressibly humorous.</p>

<p>There was never an army of men who enjoyed a
good laugh more than Paul Bunyan’s loggers. And
when they saw the giddyfish galloping after the river
they laughed till they cried. When the river finally
made it up the hill and began to roll on as usual the
loggers could hardly stop laughing even then. But
they remembered their hunger, and they again got up
to search for food. But no sooner had they started
than the river parted again, and once more the loggers
rolled and laughed over the performance of the giddyfish.
And indeed for fifty-seven hours the loggers
were unable to get away from the riverside, for no
sooner would they start to leave than the stubborn
river and the clownish giddyfish would repeat their
hilarious performance. The loggers would no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
have laughed themselves to death, or else starved, had
not King Bourbon come along with his race horses and
jockeys and saved them.</p>

<p>King Bourbon had his jockeys make a wall of horseflesh
between the laughing loggers and the river, and
they were then able to stagger back into the safety of
the forest. The king then made the loggers a speech
of apology and warning. He told them that the only
crimes punishable by death in Kansas were dealing
from the bottom of the deck, throwing a horse race or
a fight, and shooting craps with loaded dice. Those
convicted of such crimes were sentenced to watch the
giddyfish until they laughed themselves to death. The
king then asked the loggers at what games and contests
did they excel, and when they told him of their expertness
at spinning logs in rough water his face shone
with a joy that made it brighter than the diamond
in his necktie; for this new sport promised to be a
thrilling one. He ordered his lord bookmaker to bring
them on to the capital and find a place for them in the
life of the city. After giving this order, he courteously
lifted his plug hat to the loggers and, followed by his
jockeys, he set out for Topeka, which was over the next
hump.</p>

<p>After three days the loggers were themselves again
and they began to explore the delights of the city.</p>

<p>Topeka, under King Bourbon’s rule, was a city of
amusements. There were eleven racetracks, and on
each one there were seven races every afternoon.
Each morning there were five baseball games, the first
one beginning at four <span class="allsmcap">A.&#160;M.</span> Boxing and wrestling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
matches, swimming and running races, driving and
jumping contests were to be seen each Sunday in the
stadium which faced Lake Topeka. In the time
between races and contests the people played poker,
solo, rummy and pool, and shot craps in the palace,
which was the one public building in the city. In its
single vast room there were countless tables for the
players, and these tables were circled by a bar of such
circumference that a man would grow a beard while
walking the length of it. The glitter of the glasses
and mirrors back of the bar was so brilliant and the
jackets of the bartenders were so white that a beholder
seemed to look on ice and snow which dazzlingly reflected
sunlight. But the eye was soothed indeed when
its gaze dropped to the dusky mahogany bar and
searched the amber depths of a huge glass which
frothed with the sharp and fragrant liquid brewed
from foamy beervine blossoms. Even more was the
eye delighted when it caught the jolly winks that
bubbled from the most potent and jovial beverage, the
aged sap of the whisky tree. One part of the bar was
a great free lunch counter, which was always loaded
with filling and peppery food. Here the nobility and
gentry of Topeka ate and drank, King Bourbon, his
lord bookmaker and his lord bartender among all the
rest. The cooks, waiters and dishwashers had been
working three shifts on the free lunch counter, but
King Bourbon generously offered Paul Bunyan’s
kitchen crew employment there, and the lord bartender
then had to divide the day into forty-eight
shifts in order to have work for everyone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>The loggers were royally received into the grand
life of Topeka. The skill they displayed in spinning
logs on the lake each Sunday won them an honored
place in the kingdom. They became tireless players
of poker, solo, rummy, craps, and even of pool. They
drank huge quantities of beervine brew and whisky
tree sap. The free lunch made them forget the delights
of Paul Bunyan’s dinners. Soon they ceased to
consider themselves as working loggers, and they
repelled with scorn proposals to try a new life of toil,
which were slyly made by followers of Duke Dryface,
who was a cousin of the King.</p>

<p>The duke was secretly planning a revolt. He had
renounced Topeka life, and he now lived among the
serfs who brewed the beervine blossoms, aged the sap
of the whisky trees, and made all of the materials that
composed the grand life of Topeka. The serfs were
called Cornmen, after a harsh cereal which they had
devised, and which they all raised in clearings among
the whisky tree forests. Duke Dryface planned to
drive the king and his nobility and gentry from the
country and clear off the forests, level the hills and
make the whole state into a flat corn country. The
king thought him simply a harmless old crank, and
would listen to no warnings against him. But, nevertheless,
the duke had a revolt well planned for the coming
Fourth of July celebration. After bribing the bartenders,
he had substituted raw sap for the mild and
gentle aged liquors to be served on that day; he had
the Cornmen all grandly inspired, and perfectly
drilled, instructed and armed; though he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
converted the loggers, he had directed the bartenders
to fill their glasses with triple-distilled, high-powered
redeye sap on the night of the Fourth, and he was
sure that he could capture them and keep them in
bondage until the last whisky tree was felled. The
duke did not fear Paul Bunyan, for he thought the
loggers’ stories about him to be drunken exaggerations;
he thought of him as some plain leader whom they had
basely deserted, and who would no doubt be happy to
see them punished by slavery. He kept the strength
and extensiveness of his power well hidden, and the
loggers lived on blissfully in ignorance of their real
danger.</p>

<p>For many days and nights after the stampede of
his loggers Paul Bunyan had toiled on, swinging his
timber scythe with undiminished rapidity. He had
not observed the desertion of his men, or the flooding
of his camp, or the fate of the stonewood trees. But
at last his energy and strength began to fail, his pace
slackened, he swung the scythe with slower strokes, and
the intervals between the rolling thunders of falling
trees became longer and longer. Then the timber
scythe dropped from his hands, and he sank to the
ground. Now he saw for the first time the shimmering
distances of salt water which covered the stonewood
trees and all but the tallest buildings of his
camp. For seven hours he gazed on the lamentable
scene, then his head dropped to the ground. He was
not disheartened; he was only tired. He slept.</p>

<p>Days and nights went by with little change in the
unnatural season. The days of springtime came, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
here there was no spring. Summer days began, the
sultriness of the nights got increasingly heavy and
thick, and in the daytime the overpowering blaze of
the sun seemed to make the very hills shrink, while
the surface of the lake was veiled in steaming mists.
The slumbers of Paul Bunyan, Johnny Inkslinger, the
Big Swede and the blue ox became so deep that the
active careers of all of them might have ended there
ingloriously had it not been for Babe’s appetite, which
always tormented him, sleeping or waking. The Big
Swede was couched on the high-piled hay in the manger,
and Babe’s chin rested on his body. Stirred by a
hunger that would not be denied, his jaws began to
work mechanically; they closed over the fifty pound
plug of chewing tobacco that the Big Swede always
carried in his hip pocket, and it was swallowed like a
blade of grass. Babe gasped, groaned, and shuddered;
then he lunged to his feet, snorting and bellowing, for
chewing tobacco was as poisonous to him as to a circus
elephant. He gouged the Big Swede viciously with
his horns until he awoke with yells of agony and astonishment.
And not until he saw, through the stable
door, Paul Bunyan asleep on the far side of the lake
did Babe heed the foreman’s powerful remonstrances.
With a last angry toss of his horns, which threw the
Big Swede through the stable window, Babe turned
and plunged into the water. So fast did he run that
he threw foaming waves to the furthest reaches of the
lake. When he reached Paul Bunyan he emitted a
joyous bellow and eagerly began licking the great
logger’s neck. For one hour and twenty-seven minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Babe assiduously tickled him, and then Paul Bunyan
sprang to his feet with a great roar of laughter. He
felt strong and fresh; he smiled cheerfully at the blue
ox, who capered around him. He straddled Babe and
rode him across the lake to the flooded camp. There
he awakened Johnny Inkslinger, and, refusing to listen
to his apologies, he sent him out to discover the
trail taken by the loggers. By the time it was found,
Paul Bunyan and the Big Swede had the camp out of
the water and ready to move. Babe was hitched to
the buildings and the search for the errant loggers
began. As he traveled on Paul Bunyan said nothing;
his head was bowed in painful meditation. There
was still wrath in his heart for his loggers’ desertion
of him, but there was more of loneliness. Excepting
the pleasures of history-making, invention and oratory,
there had never been any joy for him like the joy that
comes from the comradeship of labor, and he wished
to feel it again. Then he feared that the loggers might
be completely lost; they were as helpless as sheep,
without understanding guidance. One moment he
swore to punish them severely, then his heart would
be softened by sad and gentle thoughts. So engrossed
was he with perplexing ideas and troubling emotions
that he did not notice the decline of heat and the new
sweetness in the air as the balmy clime of Kansas was
approached....</p>

<p>A Fourth of July in Topeka during the reign of
King Bourbon! Who would not give his fame and
fortune to have participated in one of those marvelous
celebrations! What pale and weakly imitations we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
have nowadays of the ball games between the Fats
and the Leans, of the potato races, and of all the
other ingeniously devised contests which made the
last day of King Bourbon’s reign a long procession
of glories and wonders! When will we see again
parades, marches and drills performed by uniformed
organizations as they were performed by The Bartenders’
and Bookmakers’ Bands, The Knights of the
Spotted Cubes, The Mystics and Oracles of Fistiana,
The Stentorian Order of Umpires, The Grandiose
Guild of Jockeys, The Loyal Legion of Log-burlers
and many others on that historical day in Topeka?
The last-named society was a new organization that
was composed of Paul Bunyan’s loggers. They
aroused the wildest enthusiasm when they appeared in
the line of march treading beer kegs, and for this, and
for their triumphs in the races, King Bourbon awarded
them the grand prize.</p>

<p>The bar had been closed for the celebration, and
when it was opened in the evening no one in the spruce
and jocund throngs which streamed through its doors
suspected that treason was afoot. Clinking of glasses,
guffaws, jigging feet, back-slapping, bellowed songs
and shouted jests made a tumult of rollicking and
boisterous noise as the reveling began. Urged on by
the traitorous bartenders, the nobility and gentry
drank nothing but the sap of the whisky trees. It was
a mild, mellow and soothing beverage when properly
aged, but the raw green sap which the conspirators had
supplied would suddenly addle the mind and paralyze
the nerves. The loggers, flushed with conceit over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
their day’s triumph, boasted that they were champion
drinkers also, and they dared everyone to enter drinking
contests with them. The bartenders, obeying
instructions, filled the loggers’ glasses with triple-distilled,
high-powered redeye. So they were the first
to get bleary-eyed, to wilt and to stagger about. By
the time the nobility and gentry had begun to be
affected the loggers had all stumbled outside or had
been carried out. Too late the king and his followers
realized that they were the victims of a conspiracy.
When the fumes of the powerful green sap had completely
befuddled them the spies of the Cornmen
lighted the signal fires that were to start the attack.</p>

<p>In a short time the hosts of Cornmen, with husking
hooks strapped to their left wrists, and with corn
knives swinging from their right hands, charged,
whooping and bounding, into the city. King Bourbon
and his followers, deaf, weak-kneed, color-blind, dumb
and addled, could make no resistance. They were
driven through the streets, out of the city, on through
the whisky tree forests and headed towards the far
lands of Kentucky. Duke Dryface remained behind
with the greater part of the Cornmen to secure the loggers,
who were laid out in heaps, rows, circles, squares
and fantastic groups all over the city. In three hours
half of the loggers had balls and chains locked to their
legs. Duke Dryface had begun to breathe easily and
to enjoy the first glow of complete triumph when he
became conscious of a vast shadow, an overpowering
presence. The light of the moon seemed blotted out,
the ground shook under a monstrous tread; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
sounded a bellow of rage that lifted every Cornman
and every logger seven feet into the air and whirled
them all over five times before they struck the ground
again. The rudely awakened and sobered loggers and
the affrighted Cornmen then saw the august figure of
Paul Bunyan and the blue ox looming above them.
The good and mighty man was chiding Babe for
bellowing so loudly and was restraining him from
attacking the Duke and his followers.</p>

<p>Duke Dryface had the courage of true virtue. He
fearlessly stepped up to Paul Bunyan and began a
speech. First he spoke of the sins of King Bourbon
and of the oppressions suffered by the Cornmen; he
showed the necessity for reform. Next, he went on to
prove that sin was in the very soil of Kansas, and that
this soil could only be purified by destroying the evil
forests and raising virtuous corn in their stead. That
was his main reason for wanting to make slaves of the
loggers, he said, but he hoped also to make righteous
men of them later. Paul Bunyan nodded gravely for
him to go on, and the duke then rose to the grandest
heights of eloquence in describing the moral imperfections
of the loggers. Deserters, braggarts, beer-bibbers,
gluttons, cigarette fiends, and many other evil
names he called them. Paul Bunyan listened, and the
loggers got sick with shame and fear. They had
surely sinned, they were indeed lost souls, they felt;
they would forever despise themselves. Then, just
when they had reached the lowest depths of self-loathing
and despair, they saw Paul Bunyan give an
enormous wink. Only a wink, but what forgiveness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
flashed from it, what unshakable faith seemed fixed in
its depths! That one gesture of an eyelid restored and
consoled them, for it spoke pardon and promised to
forget. The duke declaimed until dawn, but the
loggers listened complacently, grinning knowingly at
each other. Once more they would toil grandly in the
woods, once more hot cakes, ham and eggs would
sizzle for them on the long kitchen ranges, once more
they would be delighted by the wonders of noble
Sunday dinners, for by the wink of his eye Paul
Bunyan had made them his loggers again....</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan contracted for the logging-off of the
whisky trees, and this was easily accomplished by the
inspired toil of the loggers. The country was flattened
by hitching Babe to each section of logged-off land and
then turning it over. As Duke Dryface had surmised,
the land, though rolling on <em>top</em> was flat <em>underneath</em>.
So the one-time sinful soil of Kansas now lies deeply
buried, and only the barest vestiges of the grand life
devised by King Bourbon survive anywhere in the
Kansas country.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_169">ORATORICAL MEDICINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Before</span> the second season in the Hickory Hill country
there had never been a great sickness in Paul Bunyan’s
camp. The health his loggers constantly enjoyed was
due to the skill of Johnny Inkslinger, who was
physician and surgeon, as well as timekeeper, to the
good and mighty Paul Bunyan. His surgical feats
were marvelous. When ears were bitten off, for
example, in the playful jousts with which the loggers
amused themselves, it was no trick for Johnny Inkslinger
to sew them on tightly again. And when a
logger got his face walked on by calked boots the timekeeper
would fill the resulting cavities with bread
crumbs, slap on some red paint, and the victim of play
would return to the frolic, happy and unmarred. But
it was digestive ills which he understood completely;
for Paul Bunyan’s loggers like the laborers and
farmers of to-day, had most of their physical miseries
in the mysterious regions about the stomach. His
knowledge was gained by the most arduous study and
extensive research. The timekeeper wrote reports and
figured all day, he dosed the loggers and operated on
them in the evening, and the night long he read doctor
books. His Sundays and holidays he spent among the
wild creatures of the forests and seas, and these he
studied shrewdly and patiently. He examined fleas,
he explored whales, he once found the bones of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
moose who had died of old age, and he tracked the
animal to its birthplace, noting all its habits and
methods of life on his way. His knowledge was
monumental and complete, but he was content to
remain a timekeeper in position and name.</p>

<p>In the second season on Hickory Hill the life of the
camp went on as usual for a long time. For twelve
hours each day the axes rang in the undercuts, the saws
sang through bark and grain, and there was everywhere
the death shudder, the topple and crashing fall of
lofty trees. The blue ox placidly snaked the logs to
the riverside, following the Big Swede, who, lost in
dreams every trip always walked on into the water.
The fumes and exhalations of the great cookhouse were
never richer with delightful smells. In the evenings
the bunkhouses were loud with gleeful roars as the
loggers punched and kicked each other in their pastimes.
As the work went on Paul Bunyan grew
certain that this would be his greatest season among
the hardwoods. His heart warmed toward his men.
He planned for them feasts, revels, largesses, grand
rewards. All his thoughts were benevolent ones as he
directed operations. Then, at the height of his
record-breaking season, Babe, the blue ox, got a
misery.</p>

<p>It was a sly, slow, deceitful illness. It was first
marked in the decline of his sportiveness and affection.
It was his habit, when yoked and harnessed in the
morning, to make for the woods at a roaring gallop.
Always the Big Swede would grip the halter rope and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
try to hold the blue ox to a walk; always Babe would
plunge on, dragging the Big Swede after him; and
always the dutiful foreman would hit the ground once
in every ninety feet, yell, “Har noo!” and then be
yanked into the air again, for Babe would pay no heed
to the bouncing boss. In the woods the blue ox always
had to be closely watched, for he would chew up the
trees in his jestful moments as fast as they were felled,
and on the great drives he would prankishly drink the
river dry, leaving the astounded rivermen mired in the
mud of the stream bed. He was forever gouging the
Big Swede with his sharp horns or tickling Paul
Bunyan’s neck with his tongue.</p>

<p>When this playful spirit of his slackened and he
began to walk slowly to the timber each morning, it
was first thought to signify the approach of maturity,
with its graver moods. But when Paul Bunyan
discovered him one day, standing with his front feet
crossed, his head bowed, his cud vanished, and with
tears rolling from his half-closed eyes, the great logger
was alarmed. He called Johnny Inkslinger from
among his ledgers and ink barrels and ordered him to
drop all other work until Babe’s ailment was diagnosed
and cured.</p>

<p>Though he had studied all animals exhaustively,
Johnny Inkslinger had never practised veterinary
medicine, except in treating Babe’s inconsequential attacks
of hayfever and asthma. If he took the case he
would be assuming a great responsibility, he told Paul
Bunyan; he must have at least forty-seven hours to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
consider the matter. The great logger, having due respect
for the scientific temperament, granted him this,
so the timekeeper retired to his office.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan waited patiently, despite the fears and
anguish that smote him when Babe looked at him with
beseeching eyes. Work had been stopped in the
woods, and the anxious loggers spent most of their
time around the stable. The cooks, remembering
Babe’s fondness for hot cakes and fried eggs, brought
him tubfuls of them most delicately cooked, but he
would only nibble at them politely, then turn away.
Once indeed his old jestful spirit returned when the
Big Swede came near him. He set his hoof on the
foreman’s foot, and at the anguished “Har noo!” he
seemed to smile. But what a difference there was
between that shadow of merriment and the one time
gay bellow that always followed the joke! Paul
Bunyan and the loggers were deeply touched.</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger finally announced in a scientific
speech that he was prepared to examine and treat the
blue ox. He was certain, above all, that this illness
was not caused by indigestion, for Babe’s stomach had
always seemed to be iron-clad, invulnerable. When
the hay supply ran low in the wintertime Paul Bunyan
would tie a pair of green goggles over Babe’s eyes and
he would graze for weeks on the snow. He was fond
of the wires that bound his bales of hay, and he had
always eaten them without apparent injury. So
Johnny Inkslinger ignored Babe’s stomachs, but every
other part of him, from muzzle to tail brush, was
minutely scrutinized and explored. Nothing escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
observation. Six intrepid loggers with lanterns were
lowered by ropes into his throat to examine his tonsils
when he stubbornly refused to say “Ah!” But no
diseased condition could anywhere be discovered.</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger was baffled, but he would not
give up. For sixty-one hours he sat in the stable,
watching every movement of the blue ox and making
pages of notes about each one. And all of the time he
was thinking with the full power of his scientific mind,
bringing all his vast medical knowledge to the solution
of his problem. Then, just as he had reached the
darkest depths of hopelessness, a flashing idea saved
him with its light. The idea did not spring from his
science or knowledge; indeed, it seemed to be in
opposition to them. It was a simple idea, simply
inspired.</p>

<p>His gaze had been fixed for some time on the hump
which the blue ox had on his back. It was such a
hump as all ailing animals contrive, but, unoriginal as
it was, it was yet the source of an original and startling
idea, that the hump in a sick animal’s back, instead of
being the <em>result</em> of the sickness, was really the <em>cause</em> of
it! Johnny Inkslinger jumped to his feet with a shout
of joy. He saw in the idea, not only the salvation of
Paul Bunyan’s logging enterprises, but the root of a
great fame for himself as a veterinarian as well. His
jubilant calls soon roused the camp.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan listened somewhat doubtfully as the
timekeeper revealed his idea and plans. But he was
not one to oppose a scientific man with mere logic, so
he gave orders that the great treatment devised by
Johnny Inkslinger should be carried out. For five
days the loggers toiled, erecting a scaffold on each side
of the blue ox. Runways were built from the top
floors of the scaffolds to Babe’s back. Then all was
ready for the first treatment. For three hours loggers
carrying pike poles, peavys, sledges and mauls climbed
the scaffolds and extended in lines on each side of
Babe’s humped spine. Then Paul Bunyan grasped
the horns of the sick creature, Johnny Inkslinger and
the Big Swede seized his tail, the command, “Get
ready!” was given, then, “Let’s go!” Paul Bunyan
said, and the army of doctors began the cure. All
that day, through the night, and for seventy-six
consecutive hours thereafter the loggers attacked the
hump in Babe’s spine, while Paul Bunyan, Johnny
Inkslinger, and the Big Swede attempted to stretch it
to its former shape by tugging on the poor animal’s
horns and tail. Babe mooed dolorously indeed while
this treatment was being performed, and the tears
rolled from his saddened eyes in foaming torrents.
But he did not resist. Intelligent animal that he was,
he knew that his friends were only trying to drive away
his misery. And kindly of soul as he was, it was no
doubt as much to give them the pleasure of success as
to stop them from prodding, pounding and stretching
his spine that he made a heroic effort to act as cured ox.
Pretty deceiver! Once he had straightened his aching
back, how lustily he began to devour bale after bale
of bitter-tasting hay from his manger! How speedily
he emptied tubfuls of hot cakes and fried eggs, while
Hot Biscuit Slim, Cream Puff Fatty and the assistant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>cooks looked on and cheered! Never did Babe depart
more friskly for the woods than on the morning he was
pronounced cured. The Big Swede, hanging to the
halter rope, only hit the dirt once in every mile and a
half!</p>

<figure id="ip_175" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="1332" height="2057" alt="Man with pipe petting ox"></figure>

<p>The work of logging was soon in its old routine, but
Paul Bunyan was not satisfied. Babe could not hide
his spells of trembling; he moved feverishly; his
expression was haggard, his mooings hollow. Johnny
Inkslinger, still flushed with the fire of his grand idea,
was impatient with Paul Bunyan’s worriment. But
he could not quiet the great logger’s fears. When it
was noted that Hickory River would suddenly rise
three or four feet above its normal level and as
suddenly fall again, Paul Bunyan set a close watch on
the blue ox and discovered that there were times when
the hump in his back became greater than ever before,
and that torrents of tears often poured from his eyes
in fits of weeping, thus flooding the river. Firmly, but
without anger, Paul Bunyan ordered his timekeeper to
devise another treatment.</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger reluctantly admitted his failure
and again brought his powers of thought to consider
the perplexing sickness of the blue ox. But he did
not labor with the materials of his knowledge and
science. He longed to glow again with the tickling
heat of originality, to taste once more the sweet fat of
his own ideas. So he sat and thought, awaiting
inspiration, while his doctor books stood unopened on
the towering shelves of the camp office. And at last
he was rewarded by an idea that floated from mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
darkness like a bubble of golden light. It was
midnight, but his ecstatic shouts awakened the camp.
The loggers, thrilled and alarmed, rolled from their
bunks and ran in their underclothes to the camp office.
A white-clad host soon filled the broad valley and
covered the distant hills. Johnny Inkslinger then
came out of the office, carrying a box that had held
ninety-five tons of soap. He mounted this box and
began to speak. His eyes flamed, his hair waved, his
hands fanned the air. He was voluble. “Doctor or
prophet?” Paul Bunyan asked himself sadly as he
strode away, after listening for a short time. But
the loggers were enchanted as the speech went on.
Johnny Inkslinger ended each period with a mesmeric
phrase, and after he had repeated it thrice at the
ending of his speech the loggers made a chant of it.
“Milk of the Western whale! Milk of the Western
whale! Milk of the Western whale!” they roared, as
they swayed and danced in their underclothes. The
chant rose in thunders to the sky, it rolled over the
hickory forests, and it shook the rocks of far mountains.
It reëchoed for hours after the loggers had returned to
the bunkhouses.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan considered the situation bravely and
calmly. He admitted no vain regrets that he had
never studied doctoring himself. He pronounced no
maledictions on his timekeeper’s puzzling mania. He
simply considered the plain facts of his problem: if
Babe died the great logging enterprises would be
halted forever; Johnny Inkslinger was the only man
who had the science and knowledge to cure the sick ox,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
and if humored he might return to his senses; a change
to the Western coast might benefit Babe, and the milk
of the Western whale would surely do him no harm.
So the mighty logger decided to move his camp to the
West, and there let Johnny Inkslinger give him the
whale’s milk cure.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in the camp when Paul
Bunyan gave orders for the move. The blue ox,
seeming to realize that it was made for his benefit,
acted as though he was in high spirits when he was
hitched to the camp buildings and the bunkhouses
loaded with loggers. He skipped and capered along
the trail behind Paul Bunyan, Johnny Inkslinger and
the Big Swede all the way to the Mississippi. But
there he was attacked by innumerable squadrons of
Iowa horse flies. He smashed them unmercifully
with blows of his tail until the ground for miles around
was strewn with their mangled bodies, but the carnivorous
insects persisted in their assaults until Babe became
blindly enraged. He lowered his head and began
a furious charge that did not end until he reached
Colorado, where he fell exhausted. The loggers had
been made violently seasick by their bouncing journey
over the hills, and Paul Bunyan was compelled to call
a halt until they and the blue ox had recovered.
While waiting, Paul Bunyan and the Big Swede built
a landmark by heaping dirt around an upright pike
pole, and the great logger was so pleased with the
creation that he gave it a name, Pike’s Peak.</p>

<p>The trip to the coast was made without further misadventures,
and the loggers were set to work at once to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
build a whale corral, for Paul Bunyan wished to get
the cure over as soon as possible, so that his stubborn
timekeeper would begin to do some real doctoring.
The loggers grumbled loudly at working with picks
and shovels; such foreign labor demeaned them, they
said. But the exhortations which Johnny Inkslinger
delivered from his great soap box, and the alarming
condition of the blue ox, who now made no effort to
hide his sickness, but lay quietly, with closed eyes,
overwhelmed their prejudices, and they made the dirt
fly in spite of their dislike for shovels and picks. For
nine days and nights they threw dirt like badgers,
while Paul Bunyan and the Big Swede scooped it aside
and piled it into big hills. Then the whale corral was
finished, and Paul Bunyan sent the loggers to the bunkhouses.
They were so sleepy and weary that they
began to snore before they had put away their tools.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan kicked a hole in the seaward side of
the corral, and the waters of the Pacific roared into
the basin. When it was filled he began his famous
imitation of the bawl of a lonely whale, and so perfect
was his mimicry that in less than an hour an
approaching school of the leviathans was sighted.
They swam hesitatingly about the opening to the
corral for a time, but as Paul Bunyan continued to call
ever more cunningly and appealingly, they at last
entered the trap. The Big Swede then got his stool
and milk bucket, while Paul Bunyan scooped dirt into
the corral gate. Johnny Inkslinger was called from
the office, and all was ready for the first milking of a
creature of the seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>The Big Swede, who had been raised on a dairy
farm in the old country, selected a cow whale that
looked like a good milker, and Paul Bunyan, using all
his wiles of manner and tricks of voice, soon had her
playing about his hands. At last she was gentle and
quiet, and, while Johnny Inkslinger held up her tail,
the Big Swede came into the water with his bucket and
stool and began milking with all the energy and skill
that had won him the name of Sweden’s greatest milker
in his youth. With the vigorous pressure of his hands,
the whale’s milk was soon gushing into his bucket
with such force that a dozen fire engines could not
have equaled the flow. The gentled whale made no
resistance, and the pail was soon filled with healthful,
creamy milk. But just as the Big Swede was about to
rise from his stool the whale’s calf, who had been
swimming angrily about, suddenly charged the great
milker and upset him. His head lodged in the milk
bucket; he was bent double; and before he could
recover himself, the little whale had butted the breath
out of him and had spanked him blisteringly with his
corrugated tail. This incident frightened the mother
whale, and she escaped from Paul Bunyan’s hands; the
Big Swede floundered about and yelled from the depths
of the milk bucket; and the whole school of whales
plunged about the corral in a wild panic. Worst of
all, the first milking was spilled.</p>

<p>And indeed they were the whole day securing one
bucket of milk. Not until Paul Bunyan thought of
letting a whale calf suck his finger while the Big Swede
was milking its mother were the sea-going dairymen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
able to get away from the corral with one milking.
But at last the great milker limped to the shore with
a foaming pail. He was breathing in wheezes, his
clothes were in tatters, and the back of him, from
head to heels, was marked from the tail blows of the
little whales. He was the sorriest of sorry sights, but
he had a feeble smile, nevertheless, in return for Paul
Bunyan’s praise.</p>

<p>Babe took his first dose of whale’s milk resignedly
and then closed his eyes again in weariness and sighed
with pain. Paul Bunyan’s emotions smothered his
caution; he ventured to express his doubts about the
cure. Johnny Inkslinger immediately ran to the office,
brought out his great soap box and mounted it.</p>

<p>“It is a nature cure!” he cried in ringing tones.
“It cures slowly because nature cures slowly, but it
cures surely and divinely! It is a great cure because
it is a great idea, a marvelous idea, a heaven-sent idea,
an original idea, my own idea, and it is the idea that
will save us all!”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan looked for a moment into the glowing
eyes of his timekeeper and sighed. He did not reply.</p>

<p>For a week the three milked the whales twice daily
and dosed the blue ox, while the loggers slept away
their weariness. Babe took the whale’s milk meekly,
but at each successive dose he swallowed more
sluggishly, and after the fourth day he would not open
his eyes while he drank. On the day the loggers came
from the bunkhouses he refused to drink at all. Only
an occasional twitching of his eyelids showed that
life yet remained with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>“He is dying,” said Paul Bunyan.</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger mounted the great box which had
held the ninety-five tons of soap and began to speak.</p>

<p>“Fellow loggers and Paul Bunyan,” he began.
“This miraculous idea, this saving and transfiguring
<span class="locked">idea——”</span></p>

<p>“Silence!” commanded the good and mighty logger.</p>

<p>So compelling was the power of that grave and
august voice that the loggers hardly breathed as it
sounded, and the wind subsided until it made only
the faintest whisper among the trees. Then Paul
Bunyan made one of his great orations. He did not
require a soap box, he made no fantastic gestures,
and he spoke simply and smoothly. He reviewed his
enterprises and the deeds of his loggers; he dwelt
especially on the achievements and faithfulness of
Babe, the blue ox. His plain sincerity held the loggers
spellbound; for sixty-nine hours the speech went
on, and they did not so much as move an eyelash. In
conclusion, Paul Bunyan told them that Babe would
surely die, and as logging could not be done without
him, their last labor together would be to dig his grave.
He did not blame Johnny Inkslinger, he said; the best
of men may be led astray by their imaginings and fall
into evil ways. He had been a great doctor once, and
he was a noble scribe still. Then Paul Bunyan solemnly
and warningly spoke of the shadowy workings
of fate, and in somber utterance he portrayed the
pathos of yearnings, the frailty of blessings and the
ultimate vanity of all endeavor. In the last three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
hours of his oration his voice sounded as a tolling bell.
Mournfully, mournfully, the moments marched on,
and a darkness came over the hills and the sea. From
the eyes of each motionless logger the tears streamed
unchecked; they formed in puddles around each man’s
feet until all of them stood knee-deep in mud. When
the oration was finished and they had extricated themselves
and cleaned their boots, they made ready, and
they left with Paul Bunyan for the North, where he
had decided to dig Babe’s grave. The Big Swede
stayed with the dying ox, and Johnny Inkslinger hid
himself in the shadows of his office.</p>

<p>For a long time he remained there in an agony of
thought. Remorse tormented him, though Paul Bunyan
had not judged him guilty. But he suffered most
from the humiliation of failure. It was his first, but—the
thought came like a blinding flash of light—had
he failed—yet? His reservoir of ideas was inexhaustible;
as long as breath remained in the blue ox
he could try other ideas on him. Think now! It
had become as easy for him to summon grand ideas
as for a magician to conjure rabbits from a hat, and
almost instantly he had one, a superb notion, a glorious
thought!</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger rushed from the office and roused
the Big Swede, who was sitting in apathetic sadness
by the blue ox.</p>

<p>“Listen now!” commanded the timekeeper. “You
are to sit here and repeat continuously in a soothing
voice, ‘You are well. You are well. You are well.’
Do you understand? Well then—no questions now—do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
as I have told you and Babe’s life will be saved.
Do not fail, for all depends on your faithfulness!
When I have returned with Mr. Bunyan I will finish
the cure myself.”</p>

<p>The timekeeper, exulting in the certainty that his
method would positively restore health to the blue ox,
then started out on the trail of Paul Bunyan and the
loggers. They should quit their melancholy task and
return to find Babe on the road to recovery. He
would complete the cure, and logging should go on as
before.</p>

<p>The Big Swede at once began to repeat the words,
“You ban well,” according to orders. For thirty-one
hours they came from his tongue without interruption.
Then his mouth got dry and hoarseness invaded his
throat. The phrase was uttered with an effort. Then
he had to resort to whispering in Babe’s ear. And
finally even his whisper failed him.</p>

<p>The Big Swede had once nearly choked to death
after making a high dive into muddy earth, and he had
only been saved by copious doses of alcohol. The
new oratorical cures were not understandable to him,
but he remembered the potency of alcohol in clearing
out the throat, so he got up and ran to the camp office,
where he found the great carboys of the medicine once
highly prized by Johnny Inkslinger. Taking three
of them under his arm, the Big Swede returned to the
blue ox. He took a huge drink from one of them,
and he was again able to go on with the treatment.
For a few hours it was only necessary for him to drink
once every thirty minutes to drive away the hoarseness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
but it resisted stubbornly, and the periods between
the drinks grew shorter and shorter. By the
time the Big Swede had opened the last carboy of
alcohol his brain was addled by the fumes of the
liquor, and his heart was softened by its influence until
it beat only with sympathy for the blue ox. He forgot
what he was to say, and instead of repeating, “You
ban well,” he began to sigh, over and over, “Poor ol’
sick feller. Poor ol’ sick feller.” Fortunately this
horrid perversion of Johnny Inkslinger’s idea did not
last. The Big Swede’s vocal cords finally gave out,
the alcohol smothered his will and closed his eyes. He
could not resist the fogginess that crept over his brain,
and at last he fell over and began to snore.</p>

<p>Babe had lain motionless and silent while the Big
Swede was treating him, but when the foreman fell
he had knocked over the last carboy of alcohol, and the
liquor poured over the nostrils of the blue ox and
trickled into his mouth. He groaned, he stirred, his
legs quivered. Then he sat up, looking eagerly about
for more. He soon spied, through the open door of
the office, the glitter of the other containers of liquor.
Slowly, painfully, he staggered to his feet. His
tongue lolling feverishly, he stumbled towards the
office. A desperate swing of his horns crashed in the
side of the building, a flirt of his hoofs knocked the
tops from the remaining carboys, and in nineteen minutes
he had emptied them all. A vat of Epsom salts
was cleaned up in seven gulps, barrels of pills and
capsules, and cartons of powders were quickly devoured;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
in half an hour there was nothing left of the
old time medicines of Johnny Inkslinger but splinters
and broken glass.</p>

<p>Then the alcohol began to surge through the veins
of the blue ox. The frisky, exuberant spirit of his
healthy days returned. He pranced and sashayed.
He lifted his tail and bellowed. His breath came in
snorts as he lightly pawed the ground. For a time
he was content with such merry gamboling, frolicking
and romping about, then he felt a sentimental longing
for Paul Bunyan and his mates of the woods, and he
started out to find them. But the alcohol mounted
to his head, it dimmed his eyes, and he lost the trail.
He wandered into the Wet Desert country and was
caught in a terrific rainstorm. He toiled stubbornly
on, though his befuddled senses had lost all sense of
direction and he sank knee-deep into the desert mud
at every step. As he struggled ahead, weaving first
to the right, then to the left, then to the right again,
water rolled from his back and foamed in cataracts
down his dragging tail. A river coursed down the
crooked path he left behind him. He grew weak
again after he had plowed through the mud for
hours and the fever had left his blood. When the
storm passed his strength left him and he sought rest
on a high plateau.</p>

<p>There Paul Bunyan and the loggers found him, after
a three weeks’ search which had begun when the Big
Swede brought the news of his disappearance. At
first the loggers were sure he was dead, and groans of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
sorrow rose in dismal thunders from the vast host.
But Johnny Inkslinger would not give up hope. He
had repelled the lure of grand ideas at last, and he had
his old medicine case with him now. In a moment
he had emptied its store of alcohol and Epsom salts
down Babe’s throat. In a few minutes the blue ox
opened his eyes. The loggers frantically cheered.
Babe answered them with a bellow that threw even the
loggers on the farthest hills to the ground. Though
the blue ox was thin and feeble still, the vitality of
health was in his voice again. “He is cured!” said
Paul Bunyan.</p>

<p>“He is cured!” shouted the loggers, as they
scrambled to their feet.</p>

<p>“Yah,” said the Big Swede blissfully.</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger alone said nothing. He, too,
was cured.</p>

<p>Say the old loggers:</p>

<p>Ever since he took his drunken course through the
Wet Desert a stream has flowed down the crooked trail
made by the blue ox. It is called Snake River in all
the geographies. The great whale corral is known as
Coos Bay. And Babe’s unfinished grave has become
the islands and waters of Pugent Sound. The Cascade
Mountains of Washington were made from the
dirt thrown up by the loggers and Paul Bunyan when
they began to dig the grave, and a bitter dispute still
rages regarding the name for the loftiest peak. The
loggers and the people of Seattle call it Mt. Bunyan,
the people of Tacoma and the Indians call it Mt.
Tacoma, and the geographers and tourists have named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
it Mt. Rainier, after the weather, which is rainier
there than in any other part of the country.</p>

<p>So say the old loggers.</p>

<p>And loggers are truthful men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_188">NEW IOWA</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Paul Bunyan,</span> a historian first, an industrialist
second, an inventor third, an orator fourth, was perhaps
an artist in the fifth degree of his importance.
Most authorities among the loggers of to-day insist that
he was a great man of only four parts; they declare
there was no art in him. The authorities of the classroom,
less reverent and generous in their judgments,
refuse to consider him as more than an industrialist;
but the professors must be doubted a little, because
they are certainly jealous of the great logger’s simple
eloquence and his popularity with the plain people.</p>

<p>In the camps I have heard college loggers quote
a teacher whom they called Professor Sherm Shermson
as follows: “Fellows, there is no use talking. Paul
Bunyan was a conscientious logger, I guess. Maybe
he wrote <em>big</em> histories but, fellows, he didn’t write
<em>great</em> histories. And his inventions were only useful
in his logging operations; not one of them has become
a universal boon to humanity. I expect he could make
a right good speech; but, mark this point now, there
is a <em>difference</em> between a right good speech and eloquence.
Eloquence, fellows, must have morals and
ideals in it to <em>be</em> eloquence. And as Paul Bunyan had
French-Canadian blood, I must believe that his orations
had more of Latin emotionalism in them than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
of Real American ideals and morals. I guess we’ll
agree, fellows, that his Nordic foreman was a man of
greater moral force and of purer mind.”</p>

<p>I do not know the rest of the professor’s argument,
as the college loggers would listen to no doubts against
the teachings of Professor Sherm Shermson. So I
would always leave them when they went too far in
their educated talk. Some might think that Professor
Sherm Shermson was misquoted by his boys; but
the first thing college loggers hear when they come to
the woods is warnings about the dangers of telling
falsehoods in the bunkhouses; so it is probable that
the words which they attribute to Professor Sherm
Shermson are typical of the teachings about Paul
Bunyan in American universities.</p>

<p>But so long as trees are felled the race of loggers
will hold to a staunch faith in Paul Bunyan as the
supreme historian and maker of history, the most resourceful
inventor, and the most powerful orator, as
well as the most enterprising industrialist of all time.
But they too question his art. He appreciated the
folk songs and tales of his men, it is admitted, and he
had his playhouses, wherein he painted and sculped
about. His Paint Pots are still to be seen in the
Yellowstone, and his wall painting in the Grand Canyon
shows that he was clever with the brush. Most
of his sculpture was left unfinished, but it is impressive,
for all that. His beginnings for the busts of
Johnny Inkslinger and the Big Swede, the unfinished
works in the Yosemite which are called North Dome
and Half Dome, plainly show that he was no crude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
chiseler. But, it is no wonder that loggers have little
to say about their hero’s artistic creations, for these
works had nothing to do with the logging industry, and
he had no help from his men in making them. He
only amused himself with art when he had no difficult
labors to perform. Then, it is known that he opposed
the teaching and practice of art among his loggers.
He was particularly opposed to the writing of poetry
by his men. He encouraged the making of simple
songs and the telling of true tales by picked men, bunkhouse
bards; but even these favored minstrels dared
not attempt the making of grand, grave and lofty
verse.</p>

<p>The earnest and reverent critic who studies Paul
Bunyan will come to reason, however, that the master
logger’s Camp Rule 31,721, which prohibited the writing
of poetry, is no fair indication of his own feeling
for noble rimes; it only proves that he thought his
loggers no more fitted for the enjoyment of art than
they were fitted for the understanding of history or
the comprehension of scientific inventions. It is very
probable that Paul Bunyan himself wrote tragic blank
verse in his exuberant youth, and happy hunting songs
in his elder years of discouragement. But he kept
them to himself. He felt that all art was dangerous
for his loggers; he knew that poetry was especially so.
This he learned in his attempt to log off New Iowa.
For there the loggers all turned poets and nearly
ruined the logging industry.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan’s decision to move to New Iowa developed
from the thought that its healing climate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
would hasten the convalescence of Babe, the blue ox,
and that its orange palms would give his men the tough
logging which they sorely needed. Babe, having
fallen sick, had been near to perishing from Johnny
Inkslinger’s new-fangled cures; but he was saved when
the camp doctor got sense and returned to his old-fashioned
reliable remedies. The blue ox was now
cured, but he was far too weak to begin hard labor at
once. So his master was put to it to devise a plan
that would let Babe regain his strength and yet give
natural labor to the loggers.</p>

<p>Since leaving the Hickory Hill country, they had
done little of the grand work for which they were born.
They had lost a great deal of their innocent pride and
self-respect in toiling with picks and shovels; and
Johnny Inkslinger’s abandonment of scientific medical
practice for medical oratory had shaken their faith in
the integrity of his knowledge and the scope of his
power. In the time when he had written his figures
and made his cures without explaining and glorifying
them the loggers had regarded him as a worker of
mysteries and had been in great awe of him. But
now that he had revealed his mind from a soap box
the loggers only remembered his eloquent boasts and
his failure to make good. Alcohol and Epsom salts
seemed common to them now, and they laughed at the
camp doctor for having had to go back to them.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan heard them poking rough fun at
Johnny Inkslinger’s folly on their first night in the
Oregon camp, after the return was made from the Wet
Desert country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>“In words there is a magic poison which is more
powerful than the plain substance of them,” mused
Paul Bunyan. “This magic whips emotions and stuns
sense, and it overpowers any mind which is one part
sense and nine parts emotion. And these loggers of
mine ... these loggers of mine....”</p>

<p>Another clamor broke out in the bunkhouses, and
Paul Bunyan, smiling sadly, listened to hear what nonsense
his men were talking now. The bunkhouse
cranks were the leaders in the new uproar, and when
the master logger heard their words and the applause
that followed, his eyebrows drew down in a frown
which the moonlight could not penetrate, and his eyes
had a hard glitter in the shadows.</p>

<p>For the bunkhouse cranks were saying that it looked
like logging couldn’t last much longer now; the old
blue ox was in a bad way and it was hard to think he’d
ever be himself again in this here world; Johnny Inkslinger
was getting so childish that he’d probably lose
his figuring power, just as he had blundered in his
doctoring; and old Paul himself—it looked like even
he was losing his hold, as he had started to dig Babe’s
grave before the blue ox was even near dead. Old
Paul would never have given in that soon in the days
on Onion River, said the bunkhouse cranks. Things
would surely go from bad to worse, they agreed, and
it was no use to look for the good old times to come
back. The same talk was going on in all the bunkhouses
and the bards had few cheerful arguments
against it. The loggers were losing their old innocent,
exuberant, devil-may-care spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>Paul Bunyan sat down on six of the high hills above
the whale corral, pulled up a young fir tree and began
to brush his beard and ponder. He had no doubts
of his own powers and he felt that Johnny Inkslinger
was as great as ever. The timekeeper’s recent obsessions
and eccentricities were due to the lowness of
spirit, the stagnation of soul, which comes sometime
to all mental men. He was now recovered, and he
would certainly do his part in the making of logging
history as well as before, perhaps better. The trouble
now was with the loggers. True men of muscle, the
best virtues for them to possess were unquestioning
loyalty and faithfulness to their leaders and simple
confidence in them. Oratory was good for them when
it stimulated these virtues, but ideas were poisonous;
for they caused the loggers to become critics and independent
thinkers, and their minds were not fitted for
such occupations.</p>

<p>“Work and discipline will repair the damage,” decided
Paul Bunyan. “Work is the great consoler, for
in it men forget the torments and oppressions of life.
And nothing is more tormenting and oppressive to men
of muscle than ideas. My loggers shall forget them.
And strong discipline shall release them from the
troublous responsibilities of independence. Again I
shall have a camp of men who toil mightily and make
the hours between supper and sleep jolly with merry
songs and humorous tales.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Paul Bunyan rose and looked over the
fir forest which covered all the hills and threw shadows
far over the silent waters of the whale corral. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
great logger regretted that he could not remain here
and fell these splendid trees; but something more than
plain logging was needed for his present purpose. A
powerful task must be set for his men, but a task that
would not require arduous labor from the blue ox.
New Iowa best suited his need. There the climate
was as healing and mild as the one which Kansas had
possessed before the turnover of its sinfulness. Paul
Bunyan’s maps showed that New Iowa had great forests
of orange palms in its valleys, and his samples
proved that these trees were tough cutting. The start
for the New Iowa country should be made at once.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan went first to the camp office and called
out the Big Swede. He gave orders for Babe to be
harnessed and hitched to the camp buildings; then he
called, “Roll out or roll up!” for the loggers. They
came out slowly, rubbing their eyes and expressing
wonder, for they had been sleeping only a short while.
When their leader told them that he was going to take
them down to New Iowa they did not display their
usual childish excitement over a move; but they looked
from one to another with knowing grins and much eye-winking.
The bunkhouse cranks whispered, “Ol’
Paul’s off on another wild goose chase”; and some of
the boldest among them declared that they had never
seen better logging than the Oregon country offered,
and if they had their way about it they’d stay right
here.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan did not reprove them for their doubts
and impertinent remarks. With a shrewd show of
patience and forbearance, he made them a speech in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
which he cunningly portrayed their unreasoning enthusiasm
for Johnny Inkslinger’s new cures. Had it not
been for their applause, the timekeeper would have
quickly abandoned his unscientific notions, Paul Bunyan
said, and the recent troubles would have been
avoided. He hoped they had learned a lesson, the
leader continued, that they would never again look
for hurtful ideas in speeches, but for excitement, jollity
and contentment only, as that was the best that
oratory could give them. Their business was not to
think, but to fell trees. They were, beyond a doubt,
the greatest tribe of loggers that would ever march
through the woods, he said in conclusion, and as Paul
Bunyan’s men they would have glory in history. But
as thinkers they were no better than prattling children.</p>

<p>“Back to your bunks!” ordered the leader-hero.
“And I want no more nonsense from you about ideas.”</p>

<p>The loggers, blushing with shame and contrition,
were quick to obey; and they all crawled under their
blankets and hid their red faces. The Big Swede had
the buildings wired together by this time; the blue ox
was hitched to the cookhouse; Paul Bunyan, the foreman,
and the timekeeper took hold of the traces to help
pull the long load, and the start for New Iowa was
made.</p>

<p>Babe had a hard pull over the mountains, and, with
all the help that was given him, he labored slowly up
the slopes. He was wearied out when the Tall
Timber country was reached at dawn. Paul Bunyan
stopped for a rest, and the loggers came out to gaze
upon the trees whose tops were as lofty as the clouds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
The great logger himself was delighted to find trees
that towered far above his head, and he got an overpowering
desire to try an ax and a saw on them.
Here were trees that were too tall and large for his
loggers to work on; this timber was made for him and
it offered him the chance for the historical individual
logging accomplishment that he had always dreamed
about. Paul Bunyan swore loudly that, redeemed
loggers or no redeemed loggers, cured ox or uncured
ox, he would send the camp on in charge of the Big
Swede and the timekeeper and enjoy a holiday of powerful,
pleasant labor. So he set up his workshop and
built himself a crosscut saw that would span even the
largest trunks, he made a regulation felling ax of a
size to fit his hands, and he devised some wedges from
Babe’s old ox shoes.</p>

<p>The next morning the camp was started on its way
again; and as it left the Tall Timber country the loggers
looked back on the vanishing figure of their hero-leader,
and their eyes got dim, and a doleful loneliness
whispered in all their hearts.</p>

<p>“Paul Bunyan’s a good and mighty man,” they said
sincerely.</p>

<p>Happily, New Iowa was a country of such enchanting
colorful aspect that the loggers were consoled when
the camping place on Lavender River was reached.
There had lately been considerable argument in the
bunkhouses as to whether Kansas before the turnover
of sinfulness was not a more ideal country than that
around the old home camp. But here was a land
which seemed to surpass both regions. The blue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the sky looked as though it had been painted there,
and the hills, too, huge heaps of daisies, bluebells,
poppies and buttercups, were out of a picture-book.
The river got its name from its lavender color, and
its unblemished stream curved delicately through the
forests of orange palm, and the meadows of pink
clover, which were like vast but dainty rugs on the
valley floor. Pale green moss hung over the river
banks to hide any ugliness of soil, and mauve and
lemon blooms of water lilies made a lovely variance
of color in the lavender water. The orange palms
were as tall as coconut palms, and they resembled
them in shape also. The foliage, blossoms and fruit
were all in the thick crests of the tree tops; the leaves
and blooms were like those of the common orange
trees of to-day; the bark of some of the trees was purple,
on others it was gold, and a few had bark which
was wine-red. All were now in heavy bloom, and the
forests were roofed with solid masses of white blossoms,
for the orange palms stood so close together
that a logger could hardly squeeze between their
trunks.</p>

<p>All that day Paul Bunyan’s loggers wandered about,
savoring the deliciousness of the scene; at suppertime
they could not eat, for the odors of beans and stewed
onions were repugnant, after breathing the heavy-sweet
fragrances of the drowsy New Iowa air. Nor
could they enjoy songs and stories that evening, for
they still heard the canaries singing among the orange
blossoms. Neither could they sleep, for their honest
blankets seemed tough and unclean after their rollings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
of the day on the pink clover and the daisies and
buttercups.</p>

<p>But there was no poetry in the Big Swede’s soul, and
he called them out at sunup with a vulgar “Roll out
or roll up, by yeeminy!” He only thought of the
job before him, and he was out to show Paul Bunyan
that the camp had been left in capable hands.</p>

<p>The loggers, beguiled by the charms of their new
delicacies, all shaved and donned clean underclothes
before they came out to work, and the Big Swede
growled at them for being late.</p>

<p>“We gat bum yob har noo,” he said. “We gat
swamp har first, for, by yeeminy, these trees too close
for fall noo. You gat broosh hooks; climb tree; an’
aye tank you better swamp first noo. Aye gas so.”</p>

<p>The Big Swede was in a tremble from his greatest
oratorical effort, and he hastened to give the blue ox
some hay, that he might recover his composure.
When he had returned, the loggers were moving
slowly for the forests, each man carrying a brush hook
over his shoulder. When they reached the orange
palms each man selected a tree and climbed it; and
by noon thousands of purple, gold and wine-red
trunks were bare and glittering in the sun, their tops
swamped away. The ground around them was piled
six feet high with blossom-laden boughs. This,
though the loggers had swamped languidly.</p>

<p>For a week the swamping went on with fair progress,
and the Big Swede rejoiced in the thought that he
was so conducting operations that Paul Bunyan would
give him high praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>Then the loggers spent their first Sunday of indolence
in this hyacinthine land. Hot Biscuit Slim,
alarmed by the piles of uneaten food which were left
on the tables from each meal, prepared a grand feast;
he and the baker and their helpers used their skill to
the utmost on it; but it was a vain effort, for at dinner-time
not one diner appeared. The loggers had all
flocked over the hills, and they were now swimming in
the waters of the Southern Sea—those warm, crystal
waters which lapped languorously on the golden
strands of New Iowa. And the loggers got pink and
white sea shells, and when they heard the soft music
of them they began dancing, and when sundown came
they were singing also. Prancing and warbling, they
returned to camp in the moonlight, forgetting their
clothes.</p>

<p>Imagine now the wrath and perplexity of the Big
Swede next morning when he saw the loggers running
nakedly about, hopping, skipping and posing. He
roared at them till they remembered their work and
recovered their boots and clothes from the sea-shore;
but when they were once more aloft in the
orange palms they swamped off few of the blossom-laden
boughs. Instead, most of them brought out
pencils and paper and began to write.</p>

<p>It is certain that Paul Bunyan would never have
sent his camp to New Iowa if he had known that its
scenery would evoke longings to write poetry in even
the simplest souls, thus taking their energies from useful
labor. The loggers could not be blamed; for a
week now they had been tramping back and forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
through piles of orange blossoms which reached to
their armpits; a sky of painted blue had glittered
above them; lavender waters, pale green banks, pink
meadows, hills of daisies, bluebells, poppies and
buttercups had bewitched them also; and the honied
melodies of canaries had poured into their ears from
dawn to dusk each day. The devil himself, coming
to such a land, would throw down his pack of sins and
temptations and sit upon it to think out a sonnet.</p>

<p>But the Big Swede had no soul, and the loggers’
abandonment of labor puzzled and angered him. He
yelled at them until some were shaken from the trees.
But not one lost his pencil and paper. Johnny Inkslinger,
hearing the uproar, left off his figuring and
delivered an oration; but the loggers went on writing
dreamily, paying no heed to the timekeeper.</p>

<p>“You will have to give them up,” he said to the
Big Swede. “It’s a case which only Mr. Bunyan can
handle.”</p>

<p>He went back to his ledgers, and the foreman reluctantly
set out for the Tall Timber country. The
Big Swede found Paul Bunyan in such happiness over
his labor that it seemed evil to tell him disturbing
news. The great logger had all the tall trees felled
by now and he was grubbing out the stumps. He was
at work on the last row of them when the Big Swede
found him.</p>

<p>“Needing me already?” he asked jovially. “Well,
first help me drag out these stumps, then tell me your
difficulties.”</p>

<p>He said this, seeing the embarrassment of the Big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Swede and hoping to make him easy in mind. The
two mighty men then tackled the row of stumps, and
in a short time they were uprooted, leaving an enormous
chasm, the chasm which in this day is called
Yosemite.</p>

<p>“Now, there is a historical accomplishment for all
to read about,” said Paul Bunyan, with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Followed by his foreman, he then strode over to
the Bay and washed away the stains of toil. This
done, he sat down and began to brush his beard with
a young redwood tree.</p>

<p>“Now I will listen to you,” he said.</p>

<p>The Big Swede’s account of the loggers’ strange doings
astonished him. The foreman had said nothing
about their writing, for he had never heard of poetry
and had hardly noticed the papers and pencils in the
loggers’ hands.</p>

<p>“Aye tank dey yoost gat lazy noo,” he said, nodding
sagely.</p>

<p>“I hope it is nothing worse,” said Paul Bunyan.
“Laziness I can cure. But come; we must reach New
Iowa before sundown.”</p>

<p>The two great men traveled swiftly, and they
reached the orange palm forests just as the sun was
touching fluffy clouds on the Western horizon. The
loggers, gathered in the meadows around the camp,
were reading aloud from pages which they held in their
hands. They did not observe the approach of their
leaders, and when Paul Bunyan got within hearing
distance of them he stopped and listened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indentq">“Blossoms, white blossoms! Oh, orange palm blossoms!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">My heart is a-swoon with the odor of clover”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was the shouting of one logger.</p>

<p>Another’s roar sounded above the many:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“A snow of daisies on the hill,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">It never makes thee cold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This logger went on yelling about a rain of buttercups
that would not make you wet, and a soft hail of
poppy petals, and a wind of bluebells; but by and by
he seemed to get mixed up and his voice got hoarse.
Then another logger made himself heard above the
tumult of bawled rhythms. He cried:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>
<p>“Poetry!” gasped Paul Bunyan. “Thunderation!
Holy mackinaw!”</p>

<p>But the loggers did not hear him, and Shanty Boy,
the great bunkhouse bard, now made himself heard
above the din.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Oho! I am a bully boy,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That’s more truth than poetry,” murmured Paul
Bunyan, somewhat mollified. He waited to hear more
of this piece which sounded like a bunkhouse ballad;
but now Bab Babbitson, who had heretofore been
looked upon as a useless fussbudget around the camp,
began to read his poem. He had the loudest voice of
anyone among the common men, and the other loggers
stopped their own reading to listen to him.</p>

<p>He bellowed:</p>

<p>The loggers all nearly fell over when they heard
this; they were tremendously surprised, for they had
never imagined that Bab Babbitson could have it in
him. They hid their own poems, for they were
ashamed of them now, and someone lifted a shout,
“Hurrah for Bab Babbitson, the boss poet of Paul
Bunyan’s camp!” Everyone cheered and begged for
more verses. Bab Babbitson, gloriously puffed up,
was about to comply, when the loggers saw two great
shadows advancing upon them. They looked up and
beheld Paul Bunyan and the Big Swede. The great
logger’s brows were drawn in a terrible frown, and his
beard was shaking from his rage as the forest boughs
shake when a swift wind blows among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>“Are these Paul Bunyan’s loggers?” he roared. “I
don’t recognize them!”</p>

<p>The poets were all tumbled from their feet by the
force of that wrathful voice, and all but Bab Babbitson
lost their poems in the scramble.</p>

<p>“Where are my old comrades of labor?” their leader
went on more gently. “Where are the happy bunkhouse
gangs that told loggers’ tales and sang loggers’
songs after their honest twelve hours of labor were
done? Are you still loggers, or have you really degenerated
into poets?”</p>

<p>They were shamed and they did not answer; but
just then Johnny Inkslinger came out of his office and
told Paul Bunyan of the terrible effect which the climate
and scenery of New Iowa had on the soul after
some living in it.</p>

<p>“Then it is no country for loggers,” declared Paul
Bunyan.</p>

<p>He ordered the Big Swede to make the camp ready
for an immediate move, and he sent his men to the
bunkhouses.</p>

<p>Then he took the felling ax he had devised for the
tall timbers, and through the forests of orange palms he
strode, smashing them into splinters. Kicks from his
calked boots tore up the pink meadows and filled the
lavender river with mud. Next, he demolished the
hills, leaving them in scattered piles of barren sand.
He regretted that he could not dissolve the climate
also, thus banishing forever the enervating prettiness
of the land. But he felt that he had done a good
night’s work as it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>“So much for New Iowa,” he said at last, with a
sigh of weariness and content.</p>

<p>In the dark hour before dawn the camp was speeding
Northward. But Bab Babbitson was not in his
bunkhouse. Still clutching his poem, he had slipped
out ere the start was made and hid in the forest wreckage.
He was the one man in all that mighty host who
was not a born logger. And now he had found his
own country.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_207">THE HE MAN COUNTRY</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> Paul Bunyan’s time the He Man country was far
from its present tame and safe condition. It was then
a high, smooth valley which lay between the Cascade
Mountains and the Rockies. The highest peaks
towered only a few hundred feet above it. Down the
center of the valley Moron River flowed, and on each
side of this amazing stream the sage trees grew, the
wild horses roved, and the long-eared, stub-tailed
high-behinds sat with lifted front feet and savagely
sniffed the air for the scent of their hereditary enemy,
the blond wolf. There, too, the tigermunks lifted
their tails and screamed in the moonlight. The professors
maintain that the tigermunks, the blond wolves
and the high-behinds got their great size from eating
prune pits which were thrown out from Paul Bunyan’s
cookhouse, and that they were all shot by the settlers
who followed the great logger. This notion is ridiculous.
The truth is that these animals were cowards
at heart, and.... But this should be told at the end
of the story.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan moved to this region after his disastrous
experience in New Iowa, when his loggers all
turned poets. He depended on the He Man country
to make plain, honest men of them again. The super-masculine
sage trees, he was sure, would inspire them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
to anything but poetry; and the logging off of these
hard forests would be a historical achievement. But
the great logger left nothing to chance. He remembered
a species of animal which his boss farmer, John
Shears, had originated, and he ordered a herd of them
to be brought West. John Shears had proved to him
that the virility of buffalo milk was incomparable. So
Paul Bunyan planned to stuff his loggers with buffalo
milk hot cakes as an antidote to any poison of poetry
that might remain in them.</p>

<p>Thus the great logger’s first move in the He Man
country was to build a great buffalo corral and milking
pen. When it was completed the buffalos were
brought from the old home camp, and a gang of
scissor-bills came along to herd and milk them. After
their first breakfast of the new man food the loggers
got some of their old swagger back, and Paul Bunyan
was a picture of cheerfulness as he cruised the sage
trees and planned the work of his men.</p>

<p>Moron River offered a chance for the most eventful
and picturesque drive of logging history. From
its source above the Border to its mouth on the Oregon
coast it was like a huge child of a river, for it flowed
ridiculously in every mile of its course. Here it ran
smoothly for a short distance, then it would flow
jerkily, making spasmodic waves; again, its surface
would form into vast eddies that whirled like merry-go-rounds,
and from these the waters rushed in heaving
rolls of foam; there were quicksands where the
river played hide and seek, nearly disappearing in
places, miles where it turned and ran back and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
curved into its course again, making a perfect figure
eight. Moron River flowed everywhere in zigzags and
curlicues, cutting all manner of capers and didos.
Any man but Paul Bunyan would have admitted the
impossibility of making a drive on it. But he only
smiled when he saw it and said: “If my rivermen
will forget poetry they can drive it easily.”</p>

<p>The timber in this high, wide valley reached from
the Eastern slopes of the Cascade Hills to the Western
slopes of the Rockies. These sage trees resembled the
desert sagebrush of to-day. They were not large; few
of them were over two hundred feet in height, and not
one of them could give a butt log over nine feet in
diameter. But they all had many massive limbs which
were crowded with silver gray leaves, each leaf being
the size of a No. 12 shoe. The brown bark of the
sage trees was thick, loose and stringy; it would have
to be peeled from the logs before they were snaked to
the landings by the blue ox.</p>

<p>“Splendid work for the swampers and limbers,” said
Paul Bunyan, as he cruised the timber. “What a
noble logging land is the He Man country! Surely
my loggers will be re-born here into even better men
than they were before they fell into an illness of poetry
and ideas!”</p>

<p>The first day of logging in the He Man country
seemed to justify the great logger’s best hopes. The
men came out from breakfast with a swinging, swaggering
tramp, loudly smacking their lips over the
lingering flavors of buffalo milk hot cakes. This potent
food made them vigorously he in every action.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Each man chewed at least three cans of Copenhagen
and a quarter-pound of fire cut during his first twelve
hours in the woods. “P-tt-tooey! P-tt-tooey! P-tt-tooey!”
sounded everywhere among shouted oaths and
coarse bellowing. Every ax stroke buried the bit
deeply in the tough sage wood, and brown dust spurted
and gushed constantly from every singing saw.
Crash! Crash! Crash! The thunder of falling
trees sounded like a heavy cannonade. On all the loggers’
backs gray sweat stains spread from under their
suspenders, and their hair hung in dripping strings
over their red, wet faces. They had got up steam for
the first time since leaving the Hickory Hill country,
and they were rejoicing in it. Even after the eleventh
hour had passed their eyes were bright, though red-rimmed
from stinging sweat, though wrinkles of weariness
had formed around them. The men were tired
indeed; the fallers and swampers were now panting
through open mouths, and they were chewing nervously
on their tongues, as is the habit of men when
they are wearied out; but they never missed a lick,
and when Paul Bunyan called them home they could
still walk springily.</p>

<p>When they were back in camp they did not even
complain of the smeared, sticky feeling which always
follows great sweats. No one spoke delicately of
bathing; the loggers all washed and combed carelessly;
and soon they made a trampling, growling host around
the cookhouse door.</p>

<p>The rafters and beams of the great cookhouse shook
at this supper, so savagely did the loggers tackle the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
platters of bear meat. Even the bones were crushed,
ground, and devoured; and Hot Biscuit Slim and his
helpers were delighted when all the dishes were left
slick and clean.</p>

<p>That night no poems were recited in the bunkhouses,
but the loggers roared out “The Jam on Garry’s Rock”
and other plain old songs. The loggers all crawled
into their blankets at an early hour, and every one of
them emitted gruff snores as soon as he went to sleep.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan listened to them, and he praised the
saints for the He Man country. Had it not been for
this region there was no telling what continuous
plagues of poetry would have afflicted his simple men.
Now they were back to normalcy.</p>

<p>The loggers continued to improve as summer passed
and the short autumn of the He Man country ran its
course. The first snow of the cold season fell on a
redeemed camp. That snow flew in on a thundering
wind; its flakes quickly made masses of dry snow
around the bunkhouse doors; and these were swept
into huge drifts that were window-high in places when
the breakfast gong rang. The loggers roared and
cheered when they rushed out for their buffalo milk
hot cakes. Paul Bunyan listened to their basso growls
of hunger, their rumbling jovial cursing, their bellows
of laughter, and he chuckled so heartily that the snow
which had gathered on his beard was shaken over a
crowd of loggers, burying them. They dug themselves
out, whooping their appreciation of the humorous
happening, and they jestfully shook their fists at
their chuckling leader. Then, without stopping to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
dig the snow from their shirt collars, they galloped
on for the steaming cookhouse.</p>

<p>The stamping and banging, the clatter and crash,
the smoking, sucking and grinding of meal time had
never sounded with more vigor and power than on this
wild winter morning. Breakfast done, the loggers
came forth wiping their mouths with flourishing swipes
of their fists, and with much snorting thumb-blowing
of noses. When they were back in the bunkhouses,
they laced up their boots, arguing loudly the while as
to whether true savages, real tough bullies, would wear
mackinaws when it was only forty below zero.</p>

<p>“Mackinaws?” yelled the majority. “Where’s
your red bully blood, you Hunyoks? Mackinaws!
Hell, no, burlies; we won’t even button the collars of
our shirts!”</p>

<p>And then Ford Fordsen, camp tinker, bunkhouse
handyman, and prophet, got an idea which swiftly ran
through all the bunkhouses.</p>

<p>“Real rough, red-blooded, burly, bully, savage,
dirt-stomping, ear-chewing, tobacco-loving, whisker-growing,
hell-roaring He Men are not going to wear
their boots and pants like we’ve been doing,” said he.
“Look you now: here’s a ten-inch boot top, here are two
inches of wool sock above it; and there’s a pants’ leg
all tucked down nice and pretty inside of it. Mates,
it looks too delicate. It is no way for a fire-eating
logger to wear his duds. Here now; watch me and
do as I do, and be a real band of honest-to-God bullies.
This way—look!”</p>

<p>He jerked open his horn-handled old knife, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
slashed off the legs of his tin breeches, his mackinaw
pants and his overalls, just below his knees. He bit
off a jaw-full of fire cut and then stood up, his fists
on his hips, an unshaven cheek bulging with pepper-flavored
tobacco, shapeless hat down over one eye,
collar unbuttoned, suspenders stretching over his expanded
chest, and—high mark of all high marks, distinction
of distinctions—his pants ending in ragged
edges below his knees. An inch of red drawers’ legs
showed below them, there followed bands of green
wool socks, then black boot tops. Stagged pants!
The finishing touch! Poetry was crushed to earth,
never to rise triumphantly again in Paul Bunyan’s
camp. The inventive and prophetic Ford Fordsen
had about killed it.</p>

<p>The great leader was delighted beyond words when
he saw the loggers in their new costumes. He smiled
indulgently when he heard some of the more modest
among them saying that the brush would not bother
them greatly now, and that Ford Fordsen’s invention
was a mighty good useful one. This is the reason loggers
of to-day give for stagging their pants. But Paul
Bunyan knew that his men had all taken up with the
invention because it suited their natures, which had
come back to them. Most of them indeed, admitted
it. The loggers of our time should also be frank and
admit that stagged pants spring from the he-bulliness
of their souls. As Paul Bunyan said, “Etiquette,
dainty speech, sweet scents, poetry and delicate clothes
belong properly in the drawing-room, the study and
the sanctum. They are hothouse growths. Loggers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
should take pride in hard labor and rough living.
Anything that helps their Hesomeness makes them better
men. All glory to you, Ford Fordsen, for the invention
of stagged pants.”</p>

<p>He offered the bunkhouse genius his little finger.
Ford Fordsen got his arms a fourth of the way around
it, and the two inventors shook hands.</p>

<p>The months went on and the loggers’ rugged virtues
continued to gain strength from the virile buffalo milk
hot cakes. They did noble work among the sage trees
and felled so many of them that the Big Swede and
the blue ox had to go in a gallop during their working
hours to snake all the logs to the landings.</p>

<p>Now, this was the year which is mentioned in history
as the Year of the Hard Winter. But the bitterest
cold could not now chill the blood of Paul Bunyan’s
He-Men. They had never been so jolly as they were
this Christmas, and they jigged and chortled when
Paul Bunyan gave each of them a knife devised
especially for pants-stagging. The great leader had
cut out thousands of these excellent presents from two
of Babe’s old ox shoes. This was the merriest holiday
season the camp had ever known, and even the incredible
cold of New Year’s Day did not lessen the
noisy bunkhouse gayety.</p>

<p>On the last night of the old year the mercury in
the great thermometer which hung on the camp office
had dropped to four hundred degrees below zero.
Then the tube burst, and no one could tell the temperature,
but it got appreciably colder. The next
morning the boiling coffee froze on the stove, despite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
the desperate stoking of the kitchen firemen, and the
loggers had to drink hot brown ice for their morning’s
breakfast. But they tramped cheerfully to work,
nevertheless, cracking their mittened hands together
and stamping the ground as they went along. They
worked so hard to keep warm on this day that they
talked and swore but little. This was fortunate. For
on this incomparable New Year’s Day every spoken
word froze solidly in the air as soon as it was uttered.
The next day the temperature rose, but the words remained
frozen, and many a logger bumped his mouth
by walking into the HELLOS and DAMNS which
were solid in the air. But the hardy victims only
laughed through their split lips at such accidents.
These words all thawed out at once on a warmer day;
they melted in one long-drawn-out, mournful echoing
shout so unhumanly humorous in sound that the loggers
rolled with laughter to hear it.</p>

<p>Cold as the winter was, Paul Bunyan and his men
were reluctant to see it go, for every day had brought
some tickling incident. But at last the gray frost
crystals began to glitter occasionally from rays of sunshine
which filtered through the white winter mists.
Then Paul Bunyan began to plan for the hazardous
historical drive down Moron River. Spring was at
hand, and the great logger remembered his old whimsical
query:</p>

<p>“If Springtime comes can Drives be far behind?”</p>

<p>The loggers, too, sensed the approach of the driving
season, and every night the bunkhouses rang with
sounds of filing, as the rivermen sharpened calks, pike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
poles and peavies. They bellowed the old driving
songs as never before, and the floors shook as they
leaped and pranced to show the marvelous springiness
of their legs. They got so comradely in their
merriment and exuberance that the last poet among
them ventured a poem which began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“It’s all very well to be profane,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When life is as dark as night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the man worth a fuss is the man who can cuss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When everything ’round him is bright.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He got no further, for in an instant one bully had
him down, chewing savagely on his ear, while others
raked his ribs with their calks. It was the last sigh
of poetry in the camp. Paul Bunyan heard about
it and had one of the happiest hours of his life as he
rejoiced over the good news.</p>

<p>“But every silver cloud has its shadows,” he said
sensibly, when his exaltation had passed. “I still
expect great troubles and difficulties.” He was wise
indeed in this thought, for he got a troublous problem
at once.</p>

<p>Sure as the great logger had been that the powerful
buffalo milk hot cakes could only do good for his
loggers, sure as he was they could not give his men
too much red blood or make them too hellishly He,
Paul Bunyan had yet failed to reckon on the dire effects
that the virile food might have on weaker men. He
had given no thought to the scissor-bills who herded
and milked the buffalos. Throughout the fall these
men had shown nothing but their usual tameness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
amiability; during the Hard Winter they had shivered
silently by their camp fires; but now they began to
show that the powerful food was having a terrific
effect on them. Many of the buffalos had died during
the cold spell, and the scissor-bills had made pants
from the shaggy hides. Some of the high-behinds had
frozen also, and the scissor-bills had taken their skins
and made tall, flapping hats of them. Colds had
afflicted them during the winter, and for convenience
they had tied their handkerchiefs around their necks.
They took a fancy to this fashion and let the handkerchiefs
remain after their colds were gone. Their next
outbreak of virility was to unravel one of Babe’s halter
ropes and arrange a long little rope with a noose-end
from each thread of it. They practiced throwing
nooses over the posts of the buffalo corral fence until
they became quite expert in casting them. The
scissor-bills then caught wild horses with their ropes
and broke them for riding. They got to be a crazy,
noisy gang after this, and Paul Bunyan began to notice
them as they rode through the sage trees, yipping
shrilly. And then one morning they came to the hero-leader
and requested that they be called “scissor-bills”
no longer, but “buffalo boys” instead. Paul Bunyan
admired their shaggy pants, their necker-chiefs and
their tall hats, and he thoughtlessly consented to their
wishes. He did not feel that the scissor-bills had it
in them to become real He Men, but he was not a man
to discourage worthy ambitions.</p>

<p>But Paul Bunyan soon had reason to remember
one of his old sayings, that the road from the palace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
of generosity leads through a forest of perils. His
one kindly gesture towards the lowly scissor-bills made
them a powerful faction in the He Man country, and
a fierce rivalry between them and the loggers soon
developed. For they insisted on being called “buffalo
boys,” and Paul Bunyan’s best men saw an intolerable
dignity in the title. The buffalo boys painted large
B. B’s. on their hats, they painted the letters on the
buffalos and on their horses also. At calving time
they devised some irons in the shape of double B’s.,
and they branded the buffalo calves with them. The
buffalo boys grew even bolder; they began to ride
among the bunkhouses in the evenings, yipping and
yelling at the men who were earnestly preparing for
the greatest drive of history.</p>

<p>Such impudence was not long tolerated, of course,
and it got so that every morning found buffalo boys
mourning for lost ears and doctoring the wounds made
by sharp calks. But buffalo milk was running hot
in their veins, and their new courage carried them to
still greater extremes. One morning when the loggers
came to work they found that every sage tree had
B.&#160;B. burned into its bark. That day the drive was
not talked about, for the loggers plotted vengeance
as they toiled. This night they turned the buffalos
out of the corral, and the buffalo boys were out until
morning rounding up the herd. The following night
they, in turn, galloped past the bunkhouses and roped
every stovepipe that stuck above a roof. They
dragged them into the timber and hid them, and the
loggers had to dress by cold stoves the next morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
That evening, during milking time, the loggers slipped
into the buffalo boys’ tents and poured water into their
blankets; the next morning the loggers found their
boots all filled with ice, for the buffalo boys had played
such an evil trick on them during the night. The
astonishing audacity of these lowly creatures was not
to be longer endured.</p>

<p>Mark Beaucoup and his followers would not listen
to the pleas of the moderates that the punishment of
the buffalo boys be left until the drive was finished.
The bunkhouse cranks had grown savage in the He
Man country, and they now threw aside all restraint.
They yelled their rage until all the loggers got excited;
and in a short time the bunkhouses were empty,
and the loggers were marching on the buffalo boys’
camp. They closed in silently and attacked with lion-like
ferocity. The buffalo boys, their timidity vanished
now, stood up and gave vigorous battle. When
Paul Bunyan stepped into camp and called, “Roll out,
my bullies! Roll out for the big drive!” he got no
answer. Then he looked toward the buffalo corral
and saw a sea of dust surging over miles of the valley.
All over the gray surface of this sea fists were flashing
up as whitecaps jump and fall on wind-blown waters.
Paul Bunyan leaped towards the scene of conflict.</p>

<p>But the great logger’s endeavors to separate the
fighters were vain. When he got among them he had
to stand still for fear of trampling them; the buffalo
boys and the loggers crowded against his feet as they
clinched and punched, and some of them rolled under
the arches of his boots. He ordered the factions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
their camps, but they would not hear. Then Paul
Bunyan bellowed. The battlers were all thrown
down, but they bounced up fighting. Ears and fingers
were now flying up everywhere in the dust, and the
leader was alarmed by the thought that a more fearful
condition was in sight than even poetry had
threatened to bring about. The ferocious masculinity
that his two gangs of men had got from the virile hot
cakes would leave him with camps of earless and
fingerless cripples. Disaster loomed over the logging
industry once more.</p>

<p>His brain racing like a dynamo as it conceived
desperate ideas, Paul Bunyan failed to notice at first
that the dust sea had mysteriously vanished, though
the struggle still raged. Not until he saw all the loggers
and buffalo boys stop fighting and throw themselves
on the ground, each man clutching at his own
legs and howling with fear, did he realize that an unnatural
happening was saving his men from exterminating
each other. Every frantic fighter was howling,
“My boots is runnin’ over with blood! I’m a goner
sure!”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan heard them with amazement, and with
amazement he gazed on the valleys and hills. A thin
mist was rising from the ground. It vanished soon;
then Paul Bunyan saw that rain was springing from the
earth, falling up—if the term may be used—for many
feet, and then dropping back again. The first shower
had rained up the legs of the buffalo boys and the
loggers, and they had mistaken it for blood. Now
they were still rolling, moaning and bellowing. Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Bunyan’s amazement soon passed, for he was accustomed
to unnatural seasons, climates and happenings.
He was all delight that the unusual rain had stopped
the battle, and he saw no harm in it yet; he did not
know that this was a rain of such tremendous force
that it had poured through the earth....</p>

<p>For this was the Spring That the Rain Came Up
From China....</p>

<p>Harder and harder the rain came up, and it was not
long before the loggers and the buffalo boys opened
their eyes and stopped their yelling. They were
soaked all over now, and they knew that the sudden
warm wetness of their legs had not been from blood.
Paul Bunyan laughed through his beard, which was
high and dry, when he saw his men begin to run for
the camp to get out of the strange rain. The fight
was forgotten, and the logging industry was saved.</p>

<p>The ground hissed as the rain came up with new violence.
The drops became streams ... the streams
doubled ... trebled ... and in an hour there were
ten streams where only one had come up before. The
rain became a downpour—or an up-pour, rather. It
got the proportions of a cloudburst—or, perhaps it
should be said, an earthburst. The hillocks and hummocks
had forests of small fountains. In the low
places pools were forming, and these boiled with
muddy foam as myriads of miniature geysers spurted
up from them.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan, feeling great satisfaction over the
happy ending the rain had given to the conflict between
his two tribes, did not at first realize the danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
to his recent logging operations from the unnatural
rain. When he did think of the logs piled along the
river he ran swiftly to look after them. He was too
late. Moron River had already risen far over its
banks, and all of the brown, peeled sage logs, the
fruit of a season’s labor, were now tossing on a muddy
flood. The rain was coming up through the river in
sheets; torrents were pouring into the stream from
every small gully. The water was rising at the rate
of a foot a minute. It would soon be in the camp
grounds. Paul Bunyan made no attempt to retrieve
his lost logs; he now rushed to save his camp.</p>

<p>The loggers had turned their bunkhouses upside
down, because the rain had come up through the floors.
They had then set their bunks on the rafters, and they
were now snug and dry, for the rain could not pour up
through the tight roofs. The loggers left their cozy
quarters reluctantly when they heard Paul Bunyan
call, “Roll out or roll Up!” They could imagine
nothing more disagreeable than its raining up their
pants’ legs, rough He Men though they were. But
when they saw the river rising in rushing waves they
did not need Paul Bunyan’s orders to make them run
for the cookhouse. Johnny Inkslinger was wiring the
camp office and Babe’s stable to the mammoth building,
and the Big Swede was making his fastest moves
since the Dakota days as he hitched up the blue ox.
Paul Bunyan roared, “Yay, Babe!” just as the river
waters thundered into camp. The blue ox plunged
towards the Cascade Hills. He dragged the three
greatest buildings of the camp and all the loggers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
safety. But the bunkhouses were rolling over and
over in the flood.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan and his two aides saved two of the
buffalo boys, two buffalos, two high-behinds, two
tigermunks, two blond wolves, and two wild horses,
from the raging waters, but all other life perished.</p>

<p>For forty days and forty nights it rained up from
China, and then the flood receded. Paul Bunyan and
his men looked down from the Cascades and saw that
all of the old He Man country had been washed away.
It was now a low valley. There was sage in it still,
but this sage was only brush. Ridges and buttes of
gray rock were all of the old land that remained.
There was no longer any logging in the greater part
of it. But here on the new slopes of the Cascades
was a more cheering sight. For the old land over
these slopes had covered a magnificent forest of white
pine which was even finer than that around the old
home camp. The loggers shouted when they saw it.
And was it a tear, that gleam of moisture in Paul
Bunyan’s beard? If so, it was from his new happiness.</p>

<p>“It’s an ill rain,” he chuckled, “that brings no logger
wood.”</p>

<p>The two buffalo boys, like the loggers, still heroic
from their virile winter’s diet, had come through their
ordeal in good shape and the buffalos had slept all
the forty days and nights. But the other poor animals!
The wild horses were wild no longer; they had
become tame and would now eat sugar out of any
man’s hand. The buffalo boys nick-named them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
bronchos. The high-behinds, the blond wolves and
the tigermunks were all cowards at heart, and they had
been scared out of twenty years’ growth. Not one of
them was knee-high to a logger now. The Big Swede
made his first and only joke about the tigermunks,
who had been scared into the size of chips.</p>

<p>“Tigermunks!” he grinned. “Aye tank these har
ban chipmunks!”</p>

<p>And chipmunks they have been called ever since.
Paul Bunyan’s history does not tell how the high-behinds
came to be named jack rabbits, or how the
blond wolves came to be named coyotes. No doubt
they were also named humorously, for the loggers were
gay when the rain no longer came up from China.
Anyhow, the old names are no longer used in the He
Man country.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_225">EVIL INVENTIONS</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Paul Bunyan</span> knew nothing about women, but he
had heard of them with little liking for the stories he
heard. History, industry, invention and oratory were,
to his mind, the four grand elements of human life.
And women, as they were revealed in the loggers’
stories, cared little about these elements. Women
seemed to lack inventiveness especially, and this was
man’s greatest quality. Women, the great logger had
heard, were often marvelous cooks; but men had invented
both can-openers and doughnuts. Women
were excellent makers of garments; but men had invented
calked boots, mackinaws and stagged pants.
Women were assiduous readers of poetry; but men
had invented most of the poetry that these creatures
cared about. Even in the writing of history, where
inventiveness is not allowed (or <em>was</em> not, rather; for
nowadays, such is progress, many historians are good
inventors also), women had apparently done nothing.
Paul Bunyan, in the early days of his camp, often marveled
when he heard his loggers hurrahing and stamping
as they talked about the people called pretty
women. He himself could not see their use in the
grand parts of life. But when he knew his men better
he decided that women were creations of the loggers’
fancies, that they were incredible and fabulous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<p>For Paul Bunyan’s loggers only cared to feel effects;
they had no wish to think about causes. They would
make a reality out of any fancy that delighted them;
they never inquired beyond their pleasures. When
they were told that they were making history they
heard the statement with a thrill, but they did not pretend
to know what it was all about. As for inventions,
they used them joyfully, but they thought that
Paul Bunyan’s new devices just happened. “We always
sharpened our axes by rollin’ rocks down-hill,”
the loggers would say. “We’d run alongside, holdin’
the ax blades on the stones as they rolled. But in the
Big Dust country they was no rocks an’ no hills, so ol’
Paul made grindstones.” That was their story of the
invention of the grindstone, an invention to which
Paul Bunyan had given weeks of intense thought.
And as for industry, why, a man just went out and
did what old Paul told him to do. Oratory was great
stuff; it made a man feel powerful good to listen to
it; but, holy mackinaw! how was a man to remember
all the things that old Paul said? But they did like
oratory; yes, they liked it right well.</p>

<p>Now Paul Bunyan came to know that his men were
great only in the performance of their work. They
were not comprehenders and creators. They could
hardly distinguish between knowledge and fancy.
Thus the great logger came to doubt the existence of
women. He came to consider all the loggers’ ideas as
fancies and drolleries, little men’s nonsense. He seldom
listened to them; and as time went on he forgot
women along with the other notions with which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
loggers amused themselves. In oration after oration
Paul Bunyan emphasized the fact that logging was the
greatest industry, and that loggers, therefore, were the
greatest laborers; they should have no pride or
thought outside the operations of Paul Bunyan.
They believed this finally; and then their bunkhouse
songs and stories were all about work in the woods
and the river drives, and women were very seldom
thought about. Johnny Inkslinger’s oratorical medicine
swamped them with ideas one time; and later they
were seduced into poetry; but they had become bully
loggers again in the He Man country.</p>

<p>They would have kept the new innocency of their
souls, no doubt, had the forty-day flood been a week
shorter. During the first week of the flood the loggers
were excited about the strange rain which was
streaming up from China, then the muddy foaming
waters which filled the valley below their place of
refuge became a monotonous sight. Some of them began
to tease the buffalo boys, and others played with
the blond wolves, the high-behinds, the tigermunks
and the other animals which Paul Bunyan had brought
into the cookhouse. But these wild creatures had been
so frightened by the flood that they would not learn
tricks. Paul Bunyan invented picture cards for his
men and the games of poker, rummy and cribbage; but
the bunkhouse cranks were so violent at play that it
had to be given up. Then the loggers could only tell
stories, and sing and jig for amusement. During the
last week of the flood, camp stories being told out, the
loggers remembered women; and they became so interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
in songs and stories about them that they were
sorry when the flood was over and a spring day dawned
on a new green land. This morning Paul Bunyan
called, “Roll out or roll up!” but he got no answer.
The surprised leader stopped and looked into the cookhouse.
He saw Shanty Boy and three other bards
standing with their arms over each other’s shoulders.
The quartet was singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Here I sit in jail, with my back to the wall;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a red-headed woman was the cause of it all!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Red-headed woman?” Paul Bunyan stroked his
beard in perplexity. “Woman? I think I have
heard that word before. Woman ... m-m-m-hmm
... now I remember. Those creatures so strangely
fascinating to plain men. I doubted their existence.
At any rate, I hope we never meet with any. I have
had difficulties enough from ideas, poetry and floods.
My loggers shall now have hard work again and forget
these tempting memories.”</p>

<p>Once more he roared the noble call to labor. The
loggers heeded it this time, and they came out smiling
blushingly. Thereupon Paul Bunyan made them
a straightforward speech, beguiling phrased, however;
and when it was done the loggers thought only of their
work tools and of the handsome, odorous timber which
covered the new slopes below them.</p>

<p>They got new tools from the camp office; and when
the sunlight made golden trails among the pine trees
the loggers were already wet with honest sweat, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
many trees had dropped from their cutting. They
worked without great exertion, for they were soft from
their long rest, and Paul Bunyan had warned them
against sore muscles and exhaustion. As the sun rose
higher the spring air got warm and drowsy, and it
breathed a troublous languor into their beings. The
loggers went to extremes in heeding Paul Bunyan’s
cautionary advice; and in the afternoon they toiled
listlessly whenever they worked at all; but most of the
time they leaned on their axes, or against trees, and expressed
unusual wonderings. When the Big Swede
remonstrated with them they replied that they felt
weary and sore from their labor even now; old Paul
would roar, they said, if they did not take care of their
selves. They went on arguing loudly, neglecting their
work, but the Big Swede had little time for argument.
Babe, the blue ox, was now so exuberantly frisky in all
his motions that the foreman had to watch him constantly.
During this one short argument Babe had
knocked down ten acres of trees with gay swings of his
horns and had trampled them into splinters.</p>

<p>“Har noo!” yelled the Big Swede, hastily leaving
the lazy loggers. And as Babe jerked him this way
and that way, lashing the foreman with his lively tail
and making playful pokes at him with his horns, the
Big Swede grumbled, “By yeeminy! Aye tank dese
crazy t’ings lak rain fall oop play hal with may yob!”</p>

<p>The Big Swede was easily discouraged, but Paul
Bunyan had his usual hopefulness as he planned the
reorganization of his camp. Johnny Inkslinger had
left for the old home camp to discover how John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
Shears and the great farm had fared in the flood and
to get Shagline Bill’s endless freight team started with
loads of new supplies. The great logger himself had
brought his workbench out of the camp office and set
it up at the edge of the new pine forest. Then he
planned a sawmill. It was not to be such a grand mill
as he had erected on Round River in the Leaning Pine
country; but he wanted a good one that would cut at
least 10,000,000 feet of lumber in twelve hours. In
six months he should have enough lumber to make a
fair set of temporary bunkhouses for his men. In the
meantime, it was good that the spring nights were so
cheerful and warm, as the loggers could sleep in the
open air without injury or even discomfort.</p>

<p>In a week the plans were finished, and, for a millhouse
Paul Bunyan moved the back room of his camp
office over to the banks of the Moron River, which had
become a mature, decent, dependable stream since the
flood; and he put a big crew of his loggers to work,
making concrete beds for the saws and edgers and installing
the mill machinery. Work dropped to nearly
nothing in the woods. Paul Bunyan left the mill construction
under the supervision of Ford Fordsen, camp
tinker and the only bunkhouse inventor, and he went
into the woods to make his men get out logs for the
new mill.</p>

<p>Now Paul Bunyan was astonished and puzzled when
he heard his loggers re-telling the stories with which
they had amused themselves during the last week of
the flood. Instead of working, one logger would lean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
against a tree and remark that he had always liked a
little flesh on them himself; and his partner would
reply that every man had his own taste, but as for
him, give him the cute little kind that a burly could
tuck under one arm. Then a swamper would come up
and say that he didn’t care much about shape, but he
did like red hair and a wide mouth. And a limber
would join the group and say that he guessed he was
peculiar, but he didn’t have much use for the frolicksome
ones, but he liked them quiet and sort of dreamy-eyed.
Each man would argue at length for his own
inclinations, carefully respecting, however, the preferences
of the others.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan lost patience upon hearing such nonsense;
and he gave sharp orders that there was to be
no more talking in the woods. Logs were needed for
the new mill; his men were to get down to business and
forget their vain imaginings; for it was doubtful if
such fantastic creatures as they talked about really
existed.</p>

<p>For the first time in camp history Paul Bunyan’s
loggers felt that their leader was driving them, and
they worked sullenly. Their aroused memories
troubled them greatly as the spring got more of languorous
warmth, and it was torment for them to keep
their thoughts to themselves as they worked. But at
night they were free to speak; and as they lay in their
blankets among the trees they talked for hours in soft
voices, gazing dreamily at the moon and stars, and
sighingly breathing the warm, odorous air of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
spring night. And in their sleep, memories gave them
perilous dreams; and they rolled and tossed and pulled
covers and talked tenderly between snores.</p>

<p>But these memories—if they were <em>not</em> fancies—were
not so hurtful as poetry and ideas, for they
allowed the loggers to work, once Paul Bunyan had
stopped conversation about them. When the new
mill was completed, the mill pond was black with logs.
Paul Bunyan came in from the woods, and Ford Fordsen
showed him his finished work with pride. The
boilers were loaded with steam, said the bunkhouse
genius; the rollers were in their oiled boxes, the chains
were over the sprockets, and the belts were tight
around the pulleys; and the great shining bandsaw
was waiting with sharp teeth for its first bite from a
pine log.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan heard his fellow inventor with admiration,
for there was no room for envy in the great
logger’s soul. He had an honest comradely smile
for Ford Fordsen as he lifted his hand and gave the
signal for the sawing to begin. Now the exhausts
roared, the main shaft began to revolve, the chains
rattled and squeaked, and the rolls and pulleys
whirled. But the great bandsaw did not move. Ford
Fordsen ran into the mill to discover the trouble; he
returned at once, frowning a little, but not disconcerted.</p>

<p>“A slight mistake, Mr. Bunyan,” he said crisply.</p>

<p>“Yes? Explain this slight mistake, Ford Fordsen.”</p>

<p>“It is only a <em>slight</em> mistake. But we will have to
rebuild the mill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>“Well; I am happy to hear that it is only a <em>slight</em>
mistake,” said Paul Bunyan. “You can rebuild the
mill at once, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“In six months perhaps. I prefer to make my own
plans and invent some new machines that match my
own ideas. I am rather glad of this <em>slight</em> mistake.”</p>

<p>“Impudence!” roared Paul Bunyan. “Tell me at
once what is wrong.”</p>

<p>Ford Fordsen was thrown from his feet, but he got
up with dignity.</p>

<p>“You have the advantage of me in size,” he said
pounding wrathfully with his fist on the great logger’s
toe. “But I, too, am an inventor now, and I claim
equal rights with you in invention. You may have
history, for history is bunk; you may have oratory, for
your voice is larger than mine; and you may have industry,
for you possess the blue ox. But as for <span class="locked">invention——”</span></p>

<p>“Before you become an orator in spite of yourself
tell me, as inventor to inventor, if you like, about this
slight mistake,” said Paul Bunyan calmly.</p>

<p>“But I have told you that the mill must be rebuilt!”
said Ford Fordsen impatiently. “However, if you
must know, the slight mistake is this: The men who
put in the concrete base for the headrig got to talking
about women, and their minds left their job.
They ran concrete around the saw, and now the lower
part of this hundred foot band is frozen as in solid
rock. The mill, you see, must be rebuilt; and I must
be about it.”</p>

<p>“Women again!” grumbled Paul Bunyan. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
they do not exist my men soon will have invented
them. If they do exist in other lands it is easy to see
why there is no great industry, no marvelous inventions
and no making of history in any place but my camp.
Even as memories or fancies they are nuisances. But
here: I must attend to this cocky little fellow.”</p>

<p>He reached down and seized Ford Fordsen between
his thumb and forefinger and then raised him to a
level with his eyes.</p>

<p>“Your grand and exceptional notions trouble my
poor head,” said Paul Bunyan, “so I must work with
my own simple ideas. You shall be at work with your
felling ax once more this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I warn you that I’ll not do foul, sweaty labor
again, Mr. Bunyan,” said Ford Fordsen composedly.
“If you put me back in the woods I’ll preach the ten-hour
day to the loggers. And I ask you to return me
to the ground. I find this high altitude uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“Audacity!” exclaimed Paul Bunyan, so astonished
that he nearly dropped this astonishing bunkhouse
genius. “The ten-hour day! Thunderation! What
an unheard of thing! Is the sun shining? Do I wear
whiskers? Do men chew with their teeth? Is Babe
a blue ox? And—do loggers work twelve hours a
day? What devils do trail me! Ideas; poetry;
floods; women; the ten-hour day—what next? By
the holy old, roaring old, oily <span class="locked">old——”</span></p>

<p>What would certainly have been the grandest curse
of history was interrupted by the appearance of
Johnny Inkslinger on the summits of the Cascades.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Paul Bunyan’s wrath and chagrin vanished and the
light shone once more into his eyes as his interested
gaze followed the timekeeper’s progress. Shagline
Bill’s endless freight team circled down the mountains
behind Johnny Inkslinger. Paul Bunyan
dropped Ford Fordsen carelessly into his pocket and
stepped up the slopes to hear the news.</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger had a condensed report of fifteen
thousand, seven hundred and twenty-one pages which
dealt with the destruction of the great farm and the
transformation of the Smiling River country in the
unnatural rain. But he gave a more cheerful account
of a new country which he had discovered. It was
just over the mountains, he said, in the region called
Nowaday Valley. There he had procured a good load
of camp supplies. There were people in that country,
the timekeeper went on to say, people of a very strange
sort. He described them, and he ended his description
by doubting if even one out of a hundred of these
people could become a logger. Some were too ponderous,
others were marvelously fragile, and everyone
held an ax awkwardly.</p>

<p>“I have heard of such creatures,” said Paul Bunyan.
“They are real, then. But not another word must
be spoken about them. If my loggers were to hear
that some of this species which they remember so
ardently were at hand, I’d have more trouble than
poetry gave me. We must keep this a secret, Johnny
Inkslinger.”</p>

<p>Then they rose and walked over to the cookhouse,
where the kitchen crew was unloading the freight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
wagons. Paul Bunyan had forgotten Ford Fordsen.
But the impertinent bunkhouse genius had escaped
from the pocket during the conversation. He now
journeyed towards the woods, where the loggers were
doing little but talk over their memories. And it is not
difficult to imagine how much work was done after
the enraged inventor arrived with his news of Johnny
Inkslinger’s discovery.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan, with energy that was unusual even
for him, at once began to put the mill in a condition
to operate. It was a good mill as it stood, outside
of the solid saw, and he did not intend to rebuild it.
That would take time, and he wanted to have new
bunkhouses and the old camp routine as soon as possible.
In order to keep his men from thinking about
their troublesome memories it was necessary to have
most of them in the woods again and to be with them
himself. Then the bunkhouse bards would start the
camp stories and songs once more, and the loggers
would be protected at night also. So, to work.</p>

<p>Experienced as he was with inventing, Paul Bunyan
was not long in getting an idea which solved his
problem. First, he had the loggers who were detailed
on mill construction build blocks of concrete under the
floor beams of the millhouse. While they were completing
this labor he got one of his old inventions and
made many new models of it. This invention was
the steam-drive potato masher, which he had devised
for Hot Biscuit Slim, after the chief cook had originated
mashed potatoes. In this invention Paul Bunyan
had made the first known use of the steam cylinder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
He now took a battery of steam-drive potato mashers
and installed them on the new concrete blocks under
the mill. Steam pipes were connected between them;
and the new mill system was ready for a trial.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan wiped the sweat from his dripping
eyebrows and wrung out his beard; then he gave the
signal to turn on steam. The potato mashers pumped
up and down perfectly at the rate of five hundred
strokes a minute. Each stroke thrust the mill building
up forty feet and down forty feet. The big
carriage moved forward, carrying a pine log; the solid
saw met its bark and grain; then the log carriage, flashing
up and down with the millhouse, moved swiftly
ahead, and the first cant dropped on the rolls. The
new mill was a success! Paul Bunyan’s inventive
mind had triumphed again! True, the mill men got a
little seasick from going forty feet up and forty feet
down five hundred times a minute; but they soon got
accustomed to this and declared that they preferred
the bouncing saw mill to the ordinary quiet kind.</p>

<p>Now Paul Bunyan remembered Ford Fordsen.</p>

<p>“You would rebuild a mill because of a slight mistake,”
he chuckled, reaching into his pocket for the bunkhouse
genius. “Come now; I will show you how really
simple it was to solve the problem of the solid saw.”</p>

<p>But Ford Fordsen was not in Paul Bunyan’s pocket,
of course. He had not been there for a long time.
Paul Bunyan quickly guessed that the bunkhouse
genius had escaped while his leader was seated. The
great logger’s last sitting had happened just one month
ago, when he heard his returning timekeeper’s report.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
Certainly Ford Fordsen had gone to the woods with
news of Johnny Inkslinger’s discovery.</p>

<p>Knowing the difficulties which the Big Swede had
been having with the blue ox, knowing also the foreman’s
lack of oratorical powers, Paul Bunyan feared
greatly for his loggers. He ran at once for the timber
where they were supposed to be working. The loggers
were gone, and their felling tools also. And
neither the Big Swede nor the blue ox was anywhere
in the woods. The boughs of the last felled trees
were already dead and dry and the stumps of these
trees were browned by the suns of many days. The
woods were still but for the wind whispers, and the
breathing silence of the deserted timberland was
mournful to the great logger. His was a somber,
frowning countenance as he returned to camp. He
looked in Babe’s empty stable before he passed, and
two dark objects in the manger attracted him curiously.
They were strange engines, and not of his devising.
He had not seen their like before. He could lift one
in his two hands; and he did so, turning it around and
around, observing its upright boiler, its drums and
cables, and the hewn logs to which it was bolted.
Wondering how the engines had come to the manger,
Paul Bunyan put them in his two mackinaw pockets
and tramped on over the mountain towards Nowaday
Valley, knowing that there he would find his loggers.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when the leader-hero reached
the Big Fir timber which covered the slopes around
Nowaday Valley. Through the trees he saw a blue
that was bluer than the sky. Babe mooed gently as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
his master approached, but his gaze remained fixed on
the border where the green valley floor met the timber.
Smoke was rising there; and now Paul Bunyan saw
roofs and people among the firs.</p>

<p>“My loggers and the women folks,” said Paul Bunyan,
not very cheerfully.</p>

<p>He strode on through the forest, and ere long he
saw that smoke was coming from such an engine as
he had in his pockets. Ford Fordsen was at the levers;
now he jerked one, and a drum revolved swiftly, winding
a cable which whipped and slashed underbrush as
it was hauled from the timber. Then a big log to
which the cable was fastened crashed through the small
trees, plowing a deep furrow as it was dragged on.
Now Ford Fordsen jerked another lever, the big log
was lifted, and then it was lowered easily to a car
which was standing on two shining steel rails....</p>

<p>A whistle shrilled. Paul Bunyan saw his loggers
coming in droves from the woods. Ford Fordsen left
his engine and approached the great logger.</p>

<p>“So the inventor has become the industrialist
also,” said Paul Bunyan grimly. “I suppose you will
now compete with me in <span class="locked">oratory——”</span></p>

<p>“That is my affair.” Ford Fordsen interrupted his
old leader coolly. “My only business with you, Mr.
Bunyan, is to inform you that you must keep your ox
away from my donkeys.”</p>

<p>“Donkeys?”</p>

<p>“I have named my skidding machines donkey
engines. Your ox, your skidding machine, made cunning
and conscienceless from jealousy, has escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
from your foreman; he waits until night; then he
plunges out of the woods, seizes my engine in his teeth
and makes away with it. He has stolen two of them.
I demand their return.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan drew them from his pocket and
dropped them to the ground.</p>

<p>“I do not care about your donkeys, your engines,
your skidding machines,” said the great logger. “I
have come for my men.”</p>

<p>“Try and get them,” said Ford Fordsen amiably.</p>

<p>“You may have learned inventing and industry,”
said Paul Bunyan. “And you despise history. But
I shall now teach you the worth of oratory.”</p>

<p>“I grant you the privilege of attempting it,” said
Ford Fordsen pleasantly. “Instead of giving the
loggers oratory I have given them the ten-hour day.
And they have found other things.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan would not argue the merits of the ten-hour
day with Ford Fordsen. Regretting that he had
ever encouraged this man by praising his one noble
invention, stagged pants, the great logger said no more,
but went on into Nowaday Valley. He stopped at a
place where there were many cottages. They were evidently
used for bunkhouses by his loggers, as the men
had come this way after leaving the woods. They
were curious bunkhouses indeed, for the walls of each
one were painted in bright colors; there were curtains
in the windows, and every bunkhouse had a neat and
pretty yard of grass and flowers. Paul Bunyan
thought it strange that his bully loggers should tolerate
this; but he did not allow the thought to trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
him. He began to speak with his rarest eloquence.</p>

<p>If he had delivered such an oration in the old home
camp his men would have listened to him for days
without thinking of eating or sleep. They would have
been moved continuously by whatever emotions the
sounds of the orator’s rich phrases evoked; and at the
end they would have obeyed his most extravagant wish.</p>

<p>But now the loggers did not even come out of their
bright bunkhouses to hear him. Now and again a
face appeared at a window or in a doorway, but it was
always the face of one of the women folk, seeming
hostile or curious, but otherwise unmoved. Knowing
that his oratorical powers had never been greater, Paul
Bunyan was at last affected by a fear that the loggers
were now ruled by a force stronger than his own. He
put even more vigor and color into his oration, but he
now spoke with less confidence....</p>

<p>Then one of the women folk came out of the bunkhouse.
She stopped and looked up at the great logger
with brave curiosity; and he in turn was so perplexed
by the strange sight of this creature, who had something
of the appearance of a logger, but was yet so unlike
one, that he studied her and abandoned his oration.
Was it possible that such frail and useless-seeming
creatures could have powers surpassing his own?</p>

<p>Then Paul Bunyan did what every true man,
whether ditch-digger or king, has often longed painfully
to do. He now did that which men are forever
attempting in their imaginings. He lifted the woman
person in his hand and observed her as a naturalist
observes a small kitten or a mouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>This specimen of the women folk did not seem to
mind the liberty which Paul Bunyan took with her.
She sat comfortably in his hand, with her ankles
crossed, and opened a case which hung from her arm;
she gazed unconcernedly into a mirror which was in
the lid of this case; then she patted powder on her
nose and cheeks, turning her head first this way and
then that way.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan could not understand this woman
person. She could not be explained by any of his
ideas. She looked even less like a logger, now that he
saw her closely. Her feet, for one thing, were ridiculously
small, and the thin-soled slippers on them would
not last a day at work in the woods. Her socks were
of transparent, shimmering stuff, and they were pink,
like the New Iowa clover. He had never seen anything
except a cook’s apron which was like the garment
she wore, and he had never seen anything at all compared
with the curving soft shapes revealed in this
garment. Her face was something like a boy logger’s
face, but her eyes were not boy’s eyes; for some different
spirit shone in their brown lights. Her strangely
cut hair was combed straight down over her forehead
and its clipped ends made an even line above eyebrows
which were no greater than threads. Her arms were
round and white and firmly fleshed, but they seemed
to have little muscle. Her small hands surely could not
reach around an ax handle; nevertheless she was proud
of them, for she now polished her fingernails on her
pink socks and then admired the new glitter of them.</p>

<p>“I still do not understand this woman person,” whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
Paul Bunyan to himself. “I have observed her
closely, but the secret of her power is not yet known to
me. Surely my bully loggers will yet prefer my oratory
to these weak women folk. I must try again.”</p>

<p>The woman person looked up at the gusty murmur;
and on her small red mouth, and in her sunny brown
eyes, was a smile. And Paul Bunyan saw also the
tiniest of cups in each of her powdered cheeks. These,
too, were marvelous and new to him.</p>

<p>“I have had an adventure which I can talk about
for a long time,” said the woman person. “Now put
me down.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan marveled still more at the imperiousness
of this voice, which was yet so soft, so gentle and
low. He had seen one logger chew off another’s ear
for less arrogant words. And now that he looked
for them he did not discover ears on this woman
person. But she had certainly not profited by the lesson.</p>

<p>“You have not yet learned bunkhouse courtesy?”
asked Paul Bunyan conversationally.</p>

<p>The woman person shrugged her shoulders and
wrinkled her nose. She seemed to consider this a good
enough answer, for she did not speak. Paul Bunyan
wanted to chide her, and he was surprised that he
found no words for it. He felt embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Tell me, please,” he said bashfully, “how you
women folk won my loggers.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she replied, blushing a little, “we wanted
husbands and babies.”</p>

<p>More mysteries! More words without meaning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
him! This was an explanation perhaps, but it explained
nothing.</p>

<p>Now the woman person grasped two hairs of Paul
Bunyan’s beard, one in each small hand, and pulled
them playfully, smiling such a smile as he had never
seen on any logger’s face.</p>

<p>“You must go away, you know,” she said softly.
“We are all so happy here.”</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan heard a pleading strain in her strange
singing voice, but he could not interpret this sound.
He saw her wistfully smiling eyes and mouth, but he
could not read what he saw on her face. He felt the
softness of the woman person in his hand—and he
understood her a little. He learned something of her
strength, alien as it was to any strength he had known.
And he thought: I have lost my loggers; for neither
history, invention, industry nor oratory can prevail
with them against this woman person.</p>

<p>Gently Paul Bunyan put her on the ground. The
woman person’s walk was like a dance as she left him.
In the door of her bright bunkhouse she turned and
blew him a kiss. And was gone. Paul Bunyan
waved his hand. The gesture was not for the woman
person; it was a farewell to his loggers.</p>

<p>Paul Bunyan spoke no more; but he returned to
his camp at once, taking the blue ox with him over the
mountains. He told his remaining men of the women
folk and let them go. Soon or late he would lose
them, and he let them go now, that they might not be
held too long from their desire....</p>

<p>The sinking sun flashed its last blaze of red over a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
camp that was deserted of all save the great heroes and
the mighty blue ox. The Big Swede had returned and
he slept; Johnny Inkslinger figured; and Babe mooed
dolorously as the shadows clouded the silent timber.
And Paul Bunyan, the supreme inventor, the noble
historian, the master orator, the grand field marshal
of industry, mused in sad resignation on the vanity
of man’s enterprises. The logging industry, which he
had invented, would go on as long as trees grew from
the earth, and his name would be heard forever on the
tongues of men. He would have power, but it would
be only the power of a vast spirit breathing in the dark,
deep woods. He would have the glory he had
dreamed about in his beginnings ... but glory was
a poor consolation ... his life work was done....</p>

<p>The shadows got dense ... the shapes of the
heroes, and the shape of Babe, the blue ox, and the
shapes of buildings, mountains and trees merged in
the darkness. And there history leaves them.</p>

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
